I came here to scream.</strong></p><p><strong>&#8212; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinaldo_Arenas\">Reinaldo Arenas</a>, </strong><em><strong>Antes Que Anochezca</strong></em></p><p>It&#8217;s hard to convey to those who live in the free world what life is like under a totalitarian dictatorship. I&#8217;d never experienced anything remotely like it before I traveled to Cuba in 2017 to report<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/07/inside-cubas-diy-internet-revolution/\"> a story for </a><em><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/07/inside-cubas-diy-internet-revolution/\">WIRED </a></em><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/07/inside-cubas-diy-internet-revolution/\">magazine</a>, and it was one of the most memorable and unpleasant experiences of my life.</p><p>The first thing is the fear: you as an individual exist naked without any recourse against the depredations of the state. I was reporting illegally, with no journalist visa, which would have taken at best months to get. The police could have knocked on the door and hauled me away to the <em>cuartico</em> (little room) at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Marista\">Villa Marista</a>, the Cuban Lubyanka, or disappeared me into some other extrajudicial hole. The authorities did just that yesterday to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spain-demands-immediate-release-journalist-detained-cuba-2021-07-13/\">Camila Acosta</a>, a correspondent for the Spanish newspaper <em>ABC</em> for &#8220;crimes against state security.&#8221; The Founding Fathers&#8217; warnings about tyrannical kings and their obsession with <em>habeas corpus</em> hit differently when you&#8217;re confronted with an unaccountable state machine and no recourse to rule of law or individual rights.</p><p>The second thing you notice is the deception: To live in Cuba is to live in a web of lies. It begins with the media, which is pure propaganda repeated by everyone, chorus-like, or else. As a cope, everyone has a half-dozen make-believe realities in their heads, which they selectively deploy depending on whom they&#8217;re addressing. I&#8217;d ask person A about person B and they&#8217;d warn me they worked for the state and to be careful. Then I&#8217;d then speak to person B and they&#8217;d tell me the same about person A. Perhaps both were correct. I wasn&#8217;t exempt: I&#8217;d lie about what I was doing in Cuba since I wasn&#8217;t supposed to be there. Everything is a regimented fantasy. Underneath it is an ever-shifting haze of rumor, speculation, and wishful thinking.</p><p>The American tourists who visited Cuba during the Obama period saw nothing other than a Potemkin Airbnb reality they inhabited for a few dollar-fueled days. To really feel the brunt of the Cuban state you need to live as Cubans do, or run afoul of the sliver of relative freedom the state affords foreigners. I&#8217;ll share two anecdotes where that normally translucent atmosphere of repression revealed itself to me.</p><p>The first occurred while I was meeting one of the tiny number of independent journalists who around 2017 were tentatively stepping out of the official channels and launching their own blogs. (He&#8217;s in the United States now but I&#8217;ll keep his name out of it.) The scene was the Caf&#233; Mamain&#233;, one of the few trendy hangout spots that had sprung up in the relatively upscale Vedado neighborhood of Havana. The journalist was recounting his independent reporting from the eastern part of the island after Hurricane Irma, when the government (as with COVID) was caught horribly unprepared.</p><p>&#8220;By showing the reality of the government&#8217;s lack of preparation, we hope to increase accountability in our democratic process&#8230;.&#8221;</p><p>Me, the idiot American who didn&#8217;t quite understand yet how this worked, interrupted him: &#8221;What accountability? What democracy? This is a total dictatorship.&#8221;</p><p>He stared at me like I&#8217;d relieved myself on the cafe&#8217;s floor, looked quickly around us, and then proceeded to utterly ignore what I&#8217;d just said as if it hadn&#8217;t happened. In Cuba, there&#8217;s very much a Set of Things You Cannot Say. &#8220;Cancellation&#8221; is a rather harder proposition there than it is in the U.S.</p><p>The second example was at a festive barbecue held in the studio space of one of the small number of Cuban artists who have managed to sell their pieces overseas for hard dollars. The company was friendly, composed of sets of mutual friends with family in tow. The hour was late, rum had flowed, and per usual, the Cubans settled down to a convivial game of double-nine dominoes. One boy, I&#8217;d guess his age around nine or ten, was engaged in the age-old ritual of punking his elders by telling salty jokes he&#8217;d heard from adults. It was the classic humor format of putting different stock characters in a comedic situation, and joking about how they&#8217;d handle it. In this case, the joke was about waiting interminably for a bus, a common Cuban occupation:</p><p><em>Y la divorciada (and the divorced woman)&#8230;</em></p><p><em>Hahaha&#8230;.</em></p><p><em>Y el cuentapropista (and the small-business owner)&#8230;</em></p><p><em>Hahaha&#8230;</em></p><p><em>Y el fidelista (and the Fidel supporter)&#8230;</em></p><p>Suddenly the warm atmosphere was shattered as everyone, as if on a pre-arranged signal, raised their voices at once. Everyone chastised him loudly, as you would a child about to stick their hand into a fire. One couldn&#8217;t joke about Fidel supporters, even in a private social setting among friends: who knew who was an informant? Nobody wanted the knock on the door or the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_repudiation\">acto de repudio</a></em> the next day.</p><p>And just like that, the domino game went on and the boy stopped with his jokes. The reflex was automatic, as natural as covering your face when sneezing.</p><p>That&#8217;s the reality of Cuba you don&#8217;t see from a tourist hotel.&nbsp;</p><p>So is this:</p><div class=\"tweet\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/Cristi_up/status/1414452909371232256&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;<span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>@dwnews</span> <span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>@AP</span> photographer Ram&#243;n Espinosa wounded while covering Havana protests today. <span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>#SOSCuba</span> <span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>#PatriaYVida</span> &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Cristi_up&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Cristina Urdaneta&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Mon Jul 12 05:13:47 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E6ElWENWEAIN8wA.jpg&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/zwKBrUjZ7a&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null},{&quot;img_url&quot;:&quot;https://pbs.substack.com/media/E6ElWEoXoAEPlE9.png&quot;,&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;https://t.co/zwKBrUjZ7a&quot;,&quot;alt_text&quot;:null}],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:0,&quot;like_count&quot;:7,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{}}\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Cristi_up/status/1414452909371232256\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"tweet-header\"><img class=\"tweet-user-avatar\" src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/Cristi_up.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter avatar for @Cristi_up\"><span class=\"tweet-author-name\">Cristina Urdaneta </span><span class=\"tweet-author\">@Cristi_up</span></div><span class=\"tweet-fake-link\">@dwnews</span> <span class=\"tweet-fake-link\">@AP</span> photographer Ram&#243;n Espinosa wounded while covering Havana protests today. <span class=\"tweet-fake-link\">#SOSCuba</span> <span class=\"tweet-fake-link\">#PatriaYVida</span> <img class=\"tweet-photo\" src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FE6ElWENWEAIN8wA.jpg\" alt=\"Image\"><img class=\"tweet-photo\" src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fpbs.substack.com%2Fmedia%2FE6ElWEoXoAEPlE9.png\" alt=\"Image\"><div class=\"tweet-footer\"><p class=\"tweet-date\">July 12th 2021</p><span class=\"likes\"><span class=\"like-count\">7</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>And this:</p><div class=\"tweet\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/RosaMariaPaya/status/1414741252973674499&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;HOY: Grupos de militares golpean a adolescentes en las calles de Holgu&#237;n \\nRaul Castro, <span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>@DiazCanelB</span>: ASESINOS\\n\\n<span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>#SOSCuba</span> <span class=\\&quot;tweet-fake-link\\&quot;>#AbajoLaDictadura</span> \\n&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;RosaMariaPaya&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rosa Mar&#237;a Pay&#225;

To chants of &#8220;&#8216;we want vaccines&#8221;&#8217; and &#8220;down with the dictatorship,&#8221; Cubans marched in an unprecedentedly anti-government and open fashion. Protests soon spread to major cities like Havana and Santiago de Cuba and they continue even now. An uploaded Facebook video <em>&#8212;  </em>which was soon yanked, but not before being uploaded to YouTube by dissident media<a href=\"https://www.14ymedio.com/\"> 14ymedio</a> <em>&#8212;</em> shows hundreds of Cubans protesting in the streets.</p><p>A comment from a protestor walking in front of Cuba&#8217;s soaring capitol summarizes the gist of the protestors&#8217; grievances:&nbsp;&#8220;We&#8217;re here because of the repression against the people. They&#8217;ve got us starving to death, all of Havana is falling apart, and we don&#8217;t have homes. We have nothing. There&#8217;s money to build hotels and all sorts of things, and us, they&#8217;ve got us hungry and experiencing great difficulties.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Another protestor yells from behind: &#8220;62 years of dictatorship!&#8221;&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>Despite the various challenges we face, the reality is that Americans have not&nbsp; known hard times within living memory &#8212; <em>real</em> hard times, not invented ones based on Twitter dramas and &#8220;misinformation.&#8221; All that Americans have known since World War II is ever higher plateaus of freedom and material wealth, with all the horrors of the world &#8212; killing fields, political prisons, autocratic demagogues, a <em>real</em> resistance &#8212; held so far out of their mind&#8217;s eye they don&#8217;t even know what they look like anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>But there is no law of physics that dictates that the good times must continue.</p><p>The sad reality is that countries can and do choose to commit suicide, as we&#8217;ve seen with Syria and Venezuela more recently, and Cuba, three generations ago. Embracing some revolutionary philosophy that promises to heal all ills and right all wrongs, and then exploiting the worst human tendencies to implement that wild-eyed vision, is the sure path to ruin.&nbsp;</p><p>America is not remotely at the level of Cuba, but it sure seems we have a growing taste for apocalyptic politics and orthodoxies enforced by public acts of repudiation. We have developed a high tolerance for snitches sanctimoniously ratting out people publicly for personal gain, lists of Things That Cannot Be Said, and citizens huddling in private groups to share ideological samizdat they dare not discuss in public.</p><p>America wasn&#8217;t built on &#8220;content moderation&#8221; guidelines and &#8220;problematic&#8221; this and that. It was built on the inalienable right of every citizen to tell their government, as well as any fellow citizen, to go fuck themselves and read and write and do whatever they like. The perfect is often the enemy of the good, and the hellbent drive toward some supposed utopia often ruins an imperfect society that would be better served by a more fervent embrace of its founding principles. We&#8217;ve lived so comfortably in the society those principles created that we delude ourselves into thinking they can be dispensed with in the name of some newfangled orthodoxy.</p><p>I can&#8217;t help but think here of the president who avidly fought the empire of which Cuba was once the extension. In his 1967 inaugural address for California governor, Reagan issued a warning:</p><blockquote><p>Perhaps you and I have lived too long with this miracle to properly be appreciative. Freedom is a fragile thing and it's never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people.&nbsp; And those in world history who have known freedom and then lost it . . . have never known it again.</p></blockquote><p>Such a people is then condemned to live in the crumbling ruins of their once-beautiful country, as Cubans are now, struggling feebly for their own subsistence and against their own government. If you&#8217;re fortunate, you live out the rest of your days nostalgically recalling what your nation was once like, as my grandparents did, while having to build a new life in a foreign one. Some mistakes a free people get to make only once.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bariweiss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://bariweiss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p>","content:encodedSnippet":"a.image2.image-link.image2-660-1080 {\n            padding-bottom: 61.111111111111114%;\n            padding-bottom: min(61.111111111111114%, 660px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-660-1080 img {\n            max-width: 1080px;\n            max-height: 660px;\n          }\n        Cuban anti-riot police deploying alongside”‘revolutionaries” (regime thugs in civilian clothing).

I’d never experienced anything remotely like it before I traveled to Cuba in 2017 to report a story for WIRED magazine, and it was one of the most memorable and unpleasant experiences of my life.\nThe first thing is the fear: you as an individual exist naked without any recourse against the depredations of the state. I was reporting illegally, with no journalist visa, which would have taken at best months to get. The police could have knocked on the door and hauled me away to the cuartico (little room) at Villa Marista, the Cuban Lubyanka, or disappeared me into some other extrajudicial hole. The authorities did just that yesterday to Camila Acosta, a correspondent for the Spanish newspaper ABC for “crimes against state security.” The Founding Fathers’ warnings about tyrannical kings and their obsession with habeas corpus hit differently when you’re confronted with an unaccountable state machine and no recourse to rule of law or individual rights.\nThe second thing you notice is the deception: To live in Cuba is to live in a web of lies. It begins with the media, which is pure propaganda repeated by everyone, chorus-like, or else. As a cope, everyone has a half-dozen make-believe realities in their heads, which they selectively deploy depending on whom they’re addressing. I’d ask person A about person B and they’d warn me they worked for the state and to be careful. Then I’d then speak to person B and they’d tell me the same about person A. Perhaps both were correct. I wasn’t exempt: I’d lie about what I was doing in Cuba since I wasn’t supposed to be there. Everything is a regimented fantasy. Underneath it is an ever-shifting haze of rumor, speculation, and wishful thinking.\nThe American tourists who visited Cuba during the Obama period saw nothing other than a Potemkin Airbnb reality they inhabited for a few dollar-fueled days. To really feel the brunt of the Cuban state you need to live as Cubans do, or run afoul of the sliver of relative freedom the state affords foreigners. I’ll share two anecdotes where that normally translucent atmosphere of repression revealed itself to me.\nThe first occurred while I was meeting one of the tiny number of independent journalists who around 2017 were tentatively stepping out of the official channels and launching their own blogs. (He’s in the United States now but I’ll keep his name out of it.) The scene was the Café Mamainé, one of the few trendy hangout spots that had sprung up in the relatively upscale Vedado neighborhood of Havana. The journalist was recounting his independent reporting from the eastern part of the island after Hurricane Irma, when the government (as with COVID) was caught horribly unprepared.\n“By showing the reality of the government’s lack of preparation, we hope to increase accountability in our democratic process….”\nMe, the idiot American who didn’t quite understand yet how this worked, interrupted him: ”What accountability? What democracy? This is a total dictatorship.”\nHe stared at me like I’d relieved myself on the cafe’s floor, looked quickly around us, and then proceeded to utterly ignore what I’d just said as if it hadn’t happened. In Cuba, there’s very much a Set of Things You Cannot Say. “Cancellation” is a rather harder proposition there than it is in the U.S.\nThe second example was at a festive barbecue held in the studio space of one of the small number of Cuban artists who have managed to sell their pieces overseas for hard dollars. The company was friendly, composed of sets of mutual friends with family in tow. The hour was late, rum had flowed, and per usual, the Cubans settled down to a convivial game of double-nine dominoes. One boy, I’d guess his age around nine or ten, was engaged in the age-old ritual of punking his elders by telling salty jokes he’d heard from adults. It was the classic humor format of putting different stock characters in a comedic situation, and joking about how they’d handle it. In this case, the joke was about waiting interminably for a bus, a common Cuban occupation:\nY la divorciada (and the divorced woman)…\nHahaha….\nY el cuentapropista (and the small-business owner)…\nHahaha…\nY el fidelista (and the Fidel supporter)…\nSuddenly the warm atmosphere was shattered as everyone, as if on a pre-arranged signal, raised their voices at once. Everyone chastised him loudly, as you would a child about to stick their hand into a fire. One couldn’t joke about Fidel supporters, even in a private social setting among friends: who knew who was an informant? Nobody wanted the knock on the door or the acto de repudio the next day.\nAnd just like that, the domino game went on and the boy stopped with his jokes. The reflex was automatic, as natural as covering your face when sneezing.\nThat’s the reality of Cuba you don’t see from a tourist hotel. \nSo is this:\n@dwnews @AP photographer Ramón Espinosa wounded while covering Havana protests today. #SOSCuba #PatriaYVida \",\"username\":\"Cristi_up\",\"name\":\"Cristina Urdaneta\",\"date\":\"Mon Jul 12 05:13:47 +0000 2021\",\"photos\":[{\"img_url\":\"https://pbs.substack.com/media/E6ElWENWEAIN8wA.jpg\",\"link_url\":\"https://t.co/zwKBrUjZ7a\",\"alt_text\":null},{\"img_url\":\"https://pbs.substack.com/media/E6ElWEoXoAEPlE9.png\",\"link_url\":\"https://t.co/zwKBrUjZ7a\",\"alt_text\":null}],\"quoted_tweet\":{},\"retweet_count\":0,\"like_count\":7,\"expanded_url\":{}}\">\nCristina Urdaneta @Cristi_up\n@dwnews @AP photographer Ramón Espinosa wounded while covering Havana protests today. #SOSCuba #PatriaYVida \nJuly 12th 2021\n7 Likes\n\nAnd this:\n@DiazCanelB: ASESINOS\\n\\n#SOSCuba #AbajoLaDictadura \\n\",\"username\":\"RosaMariaPaya\",\"name\":\"Rosa María Payá A.\",\"date\":\"Tue Jul 13 00:19:33 +0000 2021\",\"photos\":[{\"img_url\":\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/upload/w_728,c_limit/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_120/jma62bbp84wl1bl7ziq5\",\"link_url\":\"https://t.co/4tbHvx2uCe\",\"alt_text\":null}],\"quoted_tweet\":{},\"retweet_count\":827,\"like_count\":780,\"expanded_url\":{}}\">\nRosa María Payá A. @RosaMariaPaya\nHOY: Grupos de militares golpean a adolescentes en las calles de Holguín \nRaul Castro, @DiazCanelB: ASESINOS\n\n#SOSCuba #AbajoLaDictadura \n\nJuly 13th 2021\n827 Retweets780 Likes\n\nAnd this:\n#Cuba moviliza a sus boinas negras. #SOSCuba facebook.com/rochote/videos… \",\"username\":\"RNapoles\",\"name\":\"Rolando Nápoles\",\"date\":\"Sun Jul 11 20:13:36 +0000 2021\",\"photos\":[{\"img_url\":\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/upload/w_728,c_limit/l_twitter_play_button_rvaygk,w_120/lrzpiragth4d92itcl5w\",\"link_url\":\"https://t.co/Rz61lGnfuX\",\"alt_text\":null}],\"quoted_tweet\":{},\"retweet_count\":489,\"like_count\":471,\"expanded_url\":{}}\">\nRolando Nápoles @RNapoles\nLa dictadura en #Cuba moviliza a sus boinas negras. #SOSCuba facebook.com/rochote/videos… \nJuly 11th 2021\n489 Retweets471 Likes\n\nBecause the press is unfree in Cuba, the story is fractured but sometime around Sunday July 11 protests broke out in Cuba’s San Antonio de los Baños. To chants of “‘we want vaccines”’ and “down with the dictatorship,” Cubans marched in an unprecedentedly anti-government and open fashion. Protests soon spread to major cities like Havana and Santiago de Cuba and they continue even now. An uploaded Facebook video —  which was soon yanked, but not before being uploaded to YouTube by dissident media 14ymedio — shows hundreds of Cubans protesting in the streets.\nA comment from a protestor walking in front of Cuba’s soaring capitol summarizes the gist of the protestors’ grievances: “We’re here because of the repression against the people. They’ve got us starving to death, all of Havana is falling apart, and we don’t have homes. We have nothing. There’s money to build hotels and all sorts of things, and us, they’ve got us hungry and experiencing great difficulties.” \nAnother protestor yells from behind: “62 years of dictatorship!” \n\n\nDespite the various challenges we face, the reality is that Americans have not  known hard times within living memory — real hard times, not invented ones based on Twitter dramas and “misinformation.” All that Americans have known since World War II is ever higher plateaus of freedom and material wealth, with all the horrors of the world — killing fields, political prisons, autocratic demagogues, a real resistance — held so far out of their mind’s eye they don’t even know what they look like anymore. \nBut there is no law of physics that dictates that the good times must continue.\nThe sad reality is that countries can and do choose to commit suicide, as we’ve seen with Syria and Venezuela more recently, and Cuba, three generations ago. Embracing some revolutionary philosophy that promises to heal all ills and right all wrongs, and then exploiting the worst human tendencies to implement that wild-eyed vision, is the sure path to ruin. \nAmerica is not remotely at the level of Cuba, but it sure seems we have a growing taste for apocalyptic politics and orthodoxies enforced by public acts of repudiation. We have developed a high tolerance for snitches sanctimoniously ratting out people publicly for personal gain, lists of Things That Cannot Be Said, and citizens huddling in private groups to share ideological samizdat they dare not discuss in public.\nAmerica wasn’t built on “content moderation” guidelines and “problematic” this and that. It was built on the inalienable right of every citizen to tell their government, as well as any fellow citizen, to go fuck themselves and read and write and do whatever they like. The perfect is often the enemy of the good, and the hellbent drive toward some supposed utopia often ruins an imperfect society that would be better served by a more fervent embrace of its founding principles. We’ve lived so comfortably in the society those principles created that we delude ourselves into thinking they can be dispensed with in the name of some newfangled orthodoxy.\nI can’t help but think here of the president who avidly fought the empire of which Cuba was once the extension. In his 1967 inaugural address for California governor, Reagan issued a warning:\n\nPerhaps you and I have lived too long with this miracle to properly be appreciative. Freedom is a fragile thing and it's never more than one generation away from extinction. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation, for it comes only once to a people.  And those in world history who have known freedom and then lost it . . . have never known it again.\n\nSuch a people is then condemned to live in the crumbling ruins of their once-beautiful country, as Cubans are now, struggling feebly for their own subsistence and against their own government. If you’re fortunate, you live out the rest of your days nostalgically recalling what your nation was once like, as my grandparents did, while having to build a new life in a foreign one. Some mistakes a free people get to make only once.\nSubscribe now","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99f9aaa5-f9ea-403a-b14c-7d860864726d_1080x660.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Antonio Garc&#237;a Mart&#237;nez","content":"Antonio Garc&#237;a Mart&#237;nez on what people taking to the streets are protesting.","contentSnippet":"Antonio García Martínez on what people taking to the streets are protesting.","guid":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/the-real-cuba-isnt-a-potemkin-airbnb","isoDate":"2021-07-14T15:11:37.000Z","itunes":{}},{"creator":"Bari Weiss","title":"A Witch Trial at the Legal Aid Society","link":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/a-witch-trial-at-the-legal-aid-society","pubDate":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 23:58:34 GMT","content:encoded":"<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-971-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab1a4c47-c9d0-4da5-9e0d-b4e770fc0fe9_5472x3648.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fab1a4c47-c9d0-4da5-9e0d-b4e770fc0fe9_5472x3648.jpeg\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab1a4c47-c9d0-4da5-9e0d-b4e770fc0fe9_5472x3648.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:7476601,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.68956043956044%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.68956043956044%, 971px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 971px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">A historic courthouse building in Lower Manhattan on June 30, 2020.

Every cause liberals are supposed to fight for, every group they are supposed to champion, every candidate they are supposed to support &#8212;&nbsp;well, that was Maron&#8217;s not so atypical life and career. Until recently.</p><p>A New York City native, Maron lived her early years in subsidized housing when her father walked out on her mother, who was a pediatric nurse at Lenox Hill Hospital. Her mother remarried, the family moved to Pennsylvania, and Maron returned to the city for college. While a student at Barnard, Maron was a clinic escort for Planned Parenthood. Later, she went to Cardozo Law School knowing she wanted to be a public defender. There, she was a student of Kathleen Cleaver, the former Black Panther who was then a visiting professor. (Cleaver calls Maron her &#8220;excellent research assistant&#8221; on the first page of this <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1188&amp;context=yjlh\">published paper </a>about Mumia Abu-Jamal.)</p><p>After Maron graduated from Cardozo in 1998, she joined the Legal Aid Society, where she represented the most disadvantaged people in Manhattan. She left in 2006, after the birth of her first child, and then rejoined the nonprofit in 2017, working in the Bronx. &#8220;I had always intended to go back. It just took longer than I thought because I wound up having four children over a decade. But when my youngest was 18 months I went back to work,&#8221; Maron told me over the weekend. &#8220;For me, being a public defender is more than a job. It&#8217;s who I am.&#8221;</p><p>Maron and her husband, an Argentine immigrant, chose to send all of their children to public schools. In 2017 and, again, in 2019 she was elected to the local Community Education Council &#8212; the equivalent of a school board. Then, two years ago, she decided to run as a Democrat for City Council in lower Manhattan. Maron had always been politically involved: she was a poll watcher for John Kerry in Pennsylvania during 2004 and contributed many times to Bernie Sanders&#8217;s campaign in 2016.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-600-800\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26d17d72-914c-4861-8c0b-1171190f8258_800x600.webp\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26d17d72-914c-4861-8c0b-1171190f8258_800x600.webp\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/26d17d72-914c-4861-8c0b-1171190f8258_800x600.webp&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:57994,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-600-800 {\n            padding-bottom: 75%;\n            padding-bottom: min(75%, 600px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-600-800 img {\n            max-width: 800px;\n            max-height: 600px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Maud Maron and her family.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In short, Maron is exactly the kind of lawyer you&#8217;d imagine Legal Aid would put on the cover of its brochures. But today the public defender is filing suit in the Southern District of New York against the organization to which she has dedicated her career.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit, <a href=\"https://www.fairforall.org/content/pdfs/profiles/2021-07-12-maron-sdny-complaint-full.pdf\">which you can read here</a>, claims that Maron was &#8220;discriminated against on the basis of race&#8221; by her employer, Legal Aid Society, and her union, the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys. It claims that both defendants &#8220;published knowingly false statements in furtherance of ideological and political motives divorced from the core functions of Ms. Maron&#8217;s employment.&#8221; In other words: it says she was forced out of her job because of her political views and her race, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p><p>&#8220;None of this would have happened if I just said I loved books like <em>White Fragility,</em> and I&#8217;m a fan of Bill de Blasio&#8217;s proposals for changing New York City public schools, and I planned to vote for Maya Wiley for mayor. The reason they went after me is because I have a different point of view,&#8221; she said.</p><p>That difference came out most starkly in education, and in Maron&#8217;s role on the school board and as a candidate for city council <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/07/23/forget-reading-and-math-carranza-wants-focus-on-racial-privilege-activism/\">she was outspoken in her views</a>.</p><p>&#8220;I am very open about what I stand for. I am <a href=\"https://www.district2nyc.org/nysip.html\">pro-integration</a>. I am pro-diversity. And also I reject the narrative that white parents are to blame for the failures of our school system. I object to the mayor&#8217;s proposal to get rid of specialized admissions tests to schools like Stuyvesant. And I believe that racial essentialism is racist and should not be taught in school,&#8221; she told me.</p><p>This apparently didn&#8217;t sit well with some of her colleagues.&nbsp;</p><p>The trouble began in late 2019, when Maron&#8217;s boss, Tina Luongo, informed her she was being investigated following a complaint from members of the Black Attorneys of Legal Aid Caucus and Attorneys of Color of Legal Aid. &#8220;I knew the accusations were baseless,&#8221; Maron said. &#8220;It had everything to do with them deeming me an enemy of their politics and trying to go after me at work.&#8221;</p><p>A former colleague of Maron&#8217;s said: &#8220;It was McCarthyism. That is the only word to describe it.&#8221; Like several others I spoke to, this lawyer requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.</p><p>After an investigation that entailed reviewing all her case files and interviewing her direct supervisors, which the lawsuit details, Maron was cleared in January 2020. If she were someone else &#8212; &nbsp;a little more politically astute, a little less principled &#8212; &nbsp;maybe she would have understood the episode as a warning to shut up. But on July 23, 2020, Maron published an Op-Ed in the New York Post under the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/07/23/racial-obsessions-make-it-impossible-for-nyc-schools-to-treat-parents-kids-as-people/\">headline</a> &#8220;Racial obsessions make it impossible for NYC schools to treat parents, kids as people.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Here&#8217;s how it opened:</p><blockquote><p>I am a mom, a public defender, an elected public-school council member and a City Council candidate. But at a city Department of Education anti-bias training, I was instructed to refer to myself as a &#8220;white woman&#8221; &#8212; as if my whole life reduces to my race.</p><p>Those who oppose this ideology are shunned and humiliated, even as it does nothing to actually improve our broken schools.</p><p>Though facing severe budget cuts, the DOE has spent more than $6 million for the training, which defines qualities such as &#8220;worship of the written word,&#8221; &#8220;individualism&#8221; and &#8220;objectivity&#8221; as &#8220;white-supremacy culture.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>That&#8217;s when things at work blew up. Three days after she published the piece, the Black Attorneys of Legal Aid Caucus put out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BALA_NYC/status/1287572951525666820\">lengthy statement</a> saying that &#8220;Maud Maron has no business having a career in public defense, and we&#8217;re ashamed that she works for the Legal Aid Society.&#8221; It declared: &#8220;Maud is racist, and openly so,&#8221; and offered no evidence to back up the charge. It said that this veteran public defender was a &#8220;prominent opponent of equality&#8221; and a &#8220;classic example of what 21st century racism looks like.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The statement said that Maron &#8220;is one of many charlatans who took this job not out of a desire to make a difference, but for purposes of self-imaging.&#8221; It claimed: &#8220;She pretends to favor integration while fighting against it and denying the existence of racism in education.&#8221;</p><p>The statement also accused Maron of being terrible at her job. &#8220;No public defender can legitimately claim to be a proponent of racial justice if they are lax in how they do the work,&#8221; it said, adding that &#8220;we know for a fact that Maud's commitment to zealous representation of poor people of color is questionable at best.&#8221;</p><p>One former colleague told me that the accusation of racism in an organization like Legal Aid &#8220;is the equivalent of calling someone who works at a Jewish organization anti-Jewish. It becomes impossible to work there.&#8221; Never mind that several lawyers who worked alongside Maud told me that the allegations were absurd.</p><p>&#8220;She was beyond terrific,&#8221; said James Chubinsky, Maron&#8217;s former supervisor. &#8220;When she joined the Bronx Division I didn&#8217;t understand why she wasn&#8217;t coming as a supervisor, given her resume. She handled the toughest cases and arraignments, she did an enormous amount of work, and she went out of her way to engage the less experienced lawyers in the cases she was handling,&#8221; said Chubinsky, who spent the past 41 years at the organization, until he retired a year-and-a-half ago. &#8220;Any suggestion that she was anything other than a top-flight lawyer that the Legal Aid Society should be damn proud to have on their staff is a crock.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Another former co-worker told me: &#8220;She was a great colleague. I&#8217;ve known her for two decades. She was very caring toward her clients and a very good attorney.&#8221; Did they ever see her exhibiting racist behavior or expressing racist views? &#8220;Definitely not. Not at all.&#8221;</p><p>But this lawyer wasn&#8217;t willing to defend Maron on the record. Chubinsky said he understands why: &#8220;Everybody is scared to death of the r-word,&#8221; he told me. &#8220;They live in dread that they are insufficiently radical and so they fall in line behind the most radical members of the union. There is a silent majority that keeps their heads down.

(Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\nIf you google “bleeding heart liberal,” Maud Maron might well turn up as the first hit. Every cause liberals are supposed to fight for, every group they are supposed to champion, every candidate they are supposed to support — well, that was Maron’s not so atypical life and career. Until recently.\nA New York City native, Maron lived her early years in subsidized housing when her father walked out on her mother, who was a pediatric nurse at Lenox Hill Hospital. Her mother remarried, the family moved to Pennsylvania, and Maron returned to the city for college. While a student at Barnard, Maron was a clinic escort for Planned Parenthood. Later, she went to Cardozo Law School knowing she wanted to be a public defender. There, she was a student of Kathleen Cleaver, the former Black Panther who was then a visiting professor. (Cleaver calls Maron her “excellent research assistant” on the first page of this published paper about Mumia Abu-Jamal.)\nAfter Maron graduated from Cardozo in 1998, she joined the Legal Aid Society, where she represented the most disadvantaged people in Manhattan. She left in 2006, after the birth of her first child, and then rejoined the nonprofit in 2017, working in the Bronx. “I had always intended to go back. It just took longer than I thought because I wound up having four children over a decade. But when my youngest was 18 months I went back to work,” Maron told me over the weekend. “For me, being a public defender is more than a job. It’s who I am.”\nMaron and her husband, an Argentine immigrant, chose to send all of their children to public schools. In 2017 and, again, in 2019 she was elected to the local Community Education Council — the equivalent of a school board. Then, two years ago, she decided to run as a Democrat for City Council in lower Manhattan. Maron had always been politically involved: she was a poll watcher for John Kerry in Pennsylvania during 2004 and contributed many times to Bernie Sanders’s campaign in 2016.\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-600-800 {\n            padding-bottom: 75%;\n            padding-bottom: min(75%, 600px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-600-800 img {\n            max-width: 800px;\n            max-height: 600px;\n          }\n        Maud Maron and her family.\nIn short, Maron is exactly the kind of lawyer you’d imagine Legal Aid would put on the cover of its brochures. But today the public defender is filing suit in the Southern District of New York against the organization to which she has dedicated her career. \nThe suit, which you can read here, claims that Maron was “discriminated against on the basis of race” by her employer, Legal Aid Society, and her union, the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys. It claims that both defendants “published knowingly false statements in furtherance of ideological and political motives divorced from the core functions of Ms. Maron’s employment.” In other words: it says she was forced out of her job because of her political views and her race, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\n“None of this would have happened if I just said I loved books like White Fragility, and I’m a fan of Bill de Blasio’s proposals for changing New York City public schools, and I planned to vote for Maya Wiley for mayor. The reason they went after me is because I have a different point of view,” she said.\nThat difference came out most starkly in education, and in Maron’s role on the school board and as a candidate for city council she was outspoken in her views.\n“I am very open about what I stand for. I am pro-integration. I am pro-diversity. And also I reject the narrative that white parents are to blame for the failures of our school system. I object to the mayor’s proposal to get rid of specialized admissions tests to schools like Stuyvesant. And I believe that racial essentialism is racist and should not be taught in school,” she told me.\nThis apparently didn’t sit well with some of her colleagues. \nThe trouble began in late 2019, when Maron’s boss, Tina Luongo, informed her she was being investigated following a complaint from members of the Black Attorneys of Legal Aid Caucus and Attorneys of Color of Legal Aid. “I knew the accusations were baseless,” Maron said. “It had everything to do with them deeming me an enemy of their politics and trying to go after me at work.”\nA former colleague of Maron’s said: “It was McCarthyism. That is the only word to describe it.” Like several others I spoke to, this lawyer requested anonymity out of fear of professional repercussions.\nAfter an investigation that entailed reviewing all her case files and interviewing her direct supervisors, which the lawsuit details, Maron was cleared in January 2020. If she were someone else —  a little more politically astute, a little less principled —  maybe she would have understood the episode as a warning to shut up. But on July 23, 2020, Maron published an Op-Ed in the New York Post under the headline “Racial obsessions make it impossible for NYC schools to treat parents, kids as people.” \nHere’s how it opened:\n\nI am a mom, a public defender, an elected public-school council member and a City Council candidate. But at a city Department of Education anti-bias training, I was instructed to refer to myself as a “white woman” — as if my whole life reduces to my race.\nThose who oppose this ideology are shunned and humiliated, even as it does nothing to actually improve our broken schools.\nThough facing severe budget cuts, the DOE has spent more than $6 million for the training, which defines qualities such as “worship of the written word,” “individualism” and “objectivity” as “white-supremacy culture.”\n\nThat’s when things at work blew up. Three days after she published the piece, the Black Attorneys of Legal Aid Caucus put out a lengthy statement saying that “Maud Maron has no business having a career in public defense, and we’re ashamed that she works for the Legal Aid Society.” It declared: “Maud is racist, and openly so,” and offered no evidence to back up the charge. It said that this veteran public defender was a “prominent opponent of equality” and a “classic example of what 21st century racism looks like.” \nThe statement said that Maron “is one of many charlatans who took this job not out of a desire to make a difference, but for purposes of self-imaging.” It claimed: “She pretends to favor integration while fighting against it and denying the existence of racism in education.”\nThe statement also accused Maron of being terrible at her job. “No public defender can legitimately claim to be a proponent of racial justice if they are lax in how they do the work,” it said, adding that “we know for a fact that Maud's commitment to zealous representation of poor people of color is questionable at best.”\nOne former colleague told me that the accusation of racism in an organization like Legal Aid “is the equivalent of calling someone who works at a Jewish organization anti-Jewish. It becomes impossible to work there.” Never mind that several lawyers who worked alongside Maud told me that the allegations were absurd.\n“She was beyond terrific,” said James Chubinsky, Maron’s former supervisor. “When she joined the Bronx Division I didn’t understand why she wasn’t coming as a supervisor, given her resume. She handled the toughest cases and arraignments, she did an enormous amount of work, and she went out of her way to engage the less experienced lawyers in the cases she was handling,” said Chubinsky, who spent the past 41 years at the organization, until he retired a year-and-a-half ago. “Any suggestion that she was anything other than a top-flight lawyer that the Legal Aid Society should be damn proud to have on their staff is a crock.” \nAnother former co-worker told me: “She was a great colleague. I’ve known her for two decades. She was very caring toward her clients and a very good attorney.” Did they ever see her exhibiting racist behavior or expressing racist views? “Definitely not. Not at all.”\nBut this lawyer wasn’t willing to defend Maron on the record. Chubinsky said he understands why: “Everybody is scared to death of the r-word,” he told me. “They live in dread that they are insufficiently radical and so they fall in line behind the most radical members of the union. There is a silent majority that keeps their heads down. A couple of lunatics rattle the cage, and the people at the top fall in line,” Chubinsky told me.\nThat appears to be what happened in Maron’s case. The official, verified Twitter account of the Legal Aid Society, @LegalAidNYC, retweeted the statement from the black lawyers’ group without comment. “The viciousness of the statement and the bizarre decision of Legal Aid to amplify what they knew was false was awful. But the worst part was the silence of all the people who know better, who know that there is absolutely nothing to this,” Maron said.\nThe organization remained silent while Legal Aid lawyers like Rigodis Appling tweeted statements like this:\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-186-1194 {\n            padding-bottom: 15.577889447236181%;\n            padding-bottom: min(15.577889447236181%, 186px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-186-1194 img {\n            max-width: 1194px;\n            max-height: 186px;\n          }\n        \nAnd this:\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-230-1194 {\n            padding-bottom: 19.262981574539364%;\n            padding-bottom: min(19.262981574539364%, 230px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-230-1194 img {\n            max-width: 1194px;\n            max-height: 230px;\n          }\n        \nFour of Maron’s colleagues wrote a piece in Gotham Magazine accusing her of “segregation activism” and compared her to the white mobs that opposed the Little Rock Nine.

Or to swipe right and, maybe, find our spouse.&nbsp;</p><p>Given this technological miracle, you&#8217;d think we&#8217;d be living in a state of constant bliss with marriages and birth rates through the roof. Not so much.</p><p>A recent study from the American Medical Association found that one third of men between the ages of 18 to 24 reported having no sex at all in the previous year -- and that was before the COVID lockdowns. A Pew study from last year showed that half of American singles aren&#8217;t even looking for a relationship, or even looking to go on dates. That lack of interest is also reflected in the marriage rate and the birth rate, which are both at historic lows.</p><p>What&#8217;s at a historic high is online porn.</p><p>In 2019, more than five billion hours of porn were watched just on Pornhub alone. That&#8217;s more than 500,000 years worth of time.</p><p>My guest today has been at the forefront of this change.&nbsp;</p><p>Aella has been doing sex work online and in real life for the past decade. She&#8217;s now killing on a platform called OnlyFans, where she and others charge for their explicit content.</p><p>I first discovered Aella on Twitter where I was struck by her curiosity and her heterodox politics. If you don&#8217;t follow her, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aella_Girl\">I highly recommend it</a>.</p><p>Whatever preconceptions you have about porn stars or sex work, I am confident she will challenge them.</p><p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s an edited version of my conversation with Aella:</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>For people who aren&#8217;t super online, how do you explain to them what you do for work?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>It varies depending on the person, but maybe the basic way of putting it is like: a nude Facebook. It&#8217;s like if you had to pay money to be a Facebook friend with somebody, and then they post nudes and porn on their page.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Can you give us a little bit of a sense of how long you've been in the field that you're in?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I got into sex work almost ten years ago now. I can't believe it's been that long. I started with camming. I don't know if you watch Twitch, but it's like a nude-y Twitch. It&#8217;s like broadcasting from a TV, but then you can chat to them with your keyboard. I did that for about five years, took a break, and then I got into escorting. So, IRL I would meet up with men and then have sex with them.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>And why did you go from the world of camming, which seems far more convenient and I would imagine safer, to real life escorting?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I got burned out from camming. It was really exhausting. It's basically like being a lifestream improv comedian/entertainer/really hot for around two to three hours every day. In one small study I did with camgirls, I found that the hourly amount that you made was very correlated to the total amount of hours that you put in. The more hours you work, the more money you make per hour. It's also very competitive. The ranking -- which is based on how much money you earn per hour averaged over the last 60 days -- is on the front page which affects your income a lot because that is how men find you. If you log on and you do a live stream and nobody tips you for an hour it&#8217;s stressful, not just because you're wasting your time, but because this is actively adversely impacting your ranking on the page. It can be a really stressful experience because it's a snowball in both directions. After about five years of having to do these live performances I just couldn't bring myself to do it anymore. And then I quit and went into crypto for a bit. And after working there, I figured I wanted more money.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong><em>laughs</em></p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> I had a friend who was an escort and I'd always kind of known that this was a thing I could potentially get into. But at one point I was like, OK, I need to actually start working for myself again, for a world that I own and control because working for somebody else's company was really unpleasant. And so I did a call, and she sort of told me the basics; how to stay safe, and how to advertise. And then I went from there and became a high-end escort pretty quickly. And I did that for about a year and a half. Then after COVID hit, it made it a little bit awkward to be meeting with men who are mostly older and probably very at risk of getting sick. I didn't want to accidentally kill anybody, so I switched to OnlyFans, which was starting to boom at that point. That's what I've been doing since.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I&#8217;m wondering if you can walk me through what an average day in your professional life looks like.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>So the day varies a lot, but often when I wake up, I&#8217;ll check my OnlyFans to see how I did overnight, and see how many likes I got from my posts on Reddit. Reddit is a content aggregator. You can post things there and if people like them, they upvote them and they go to the top and there's groups that are &#8216;Not Safe For Work&#8217;. A big source of subscribers for people on OnlyFans is posting to the NSFW subreddits, so I automate those posts. I schedule them in advance because certain times are better to post than others because they're more likely to get more views.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Are those posts like essentially marketing for your OnlyFans?</p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> Yes. Probably 20 percent of my actual work is spent inside of OnlyFans producing content for OnlyFans. When I take content, I take a bunch of photos of myself, mostly selfies in various states of undress. I will take a couple of those photos and some short videos, gifs, and I will pull them out and have those be my marketing section. So typically they're not explicit. I save the explicit stuff for my OnlyFans. I have specific angles of labia that I'm willing to show in public versus through the locked paywall. And so I take the ones that fit the correct criteria and then I put them into circulation for my marketing thing, so I post them on Reddit or on Twitter. I have a NSFW group on Telegram, too, so all of these photos will get circulated through that cycle.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Got it. OK, so that's first thing in the morning. You're seeing how that did overnight. And then what comes next?</p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> I&#8217;ll catch up on messages a little bit. So people will have DM-ed me, and sometimes they attach tips when they message you. And then around 3 or 4 I will shoot some videos or photos. I typically try and get like a couple every day. So I&#8217;ll take an hour and knock out a little bit of photos, short videos of me, like bouncing or dancing or teasing really heavily. Some days, not always, instead of doing this, I will film a porno. I usually go on PornHub, look at the top ranked videos for this week and I pick one that I can replicate. And I use that as a template to do myself so that I don't have to actually have to think of an original creative porn to do. I pick something I know works and then I do that. I sell that porn through DMS. So I mass message this video into the DMS of people following me, which means that they get a locked box and a description of the video and if they click the box, then they will unlock it. They have to pay, so I select a price, and then I get eighty percent of everything they pay.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>In a sense this is the oldest profession in the world, but what makes it feel different to me is the personalization aspect. Let's say I slid into your DMS on Twitter or I found a way to write to you on OnlyFans, and I asked you for a picture of your boobs just for me. Could I get that picture that's just made for me? And is there a difference between the pricing for that and the, let's say, the boob picture that 100 people are getting?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I mean, this is kind of philosophical. Are the boobs truly the same boobs? Is the digital photo unique? But, yes, you can ask for a unique photo and oftentimes people will ask for some sort of sign with the photo or a video of you saying their name. It's very common for girls to sell unique things that aren't unique because it's in DMs, so nobody else could see what anybody else is getting. If someone asks for a boob photo, you coulf pull any random boob photo that you have saved, so often people ask for some sort of verification. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>What I find interesting is that I think the narrative around porn and sex work is just that people want tits and ass, but actually what they want is the exclusivity to feel like you're giving something that's just made for them.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>Oh, yeah. I think that this is why OnlyFans has skyrocketed so much. A lot of people are very confused about it. I could be rationalizing in hindsight, but it's really interesting the comparison between the way that camming works and OnlyFans. On camming, you're kind of in a community of men who are watching this woman because you can see everything that everybody else is saying, and you are there to witness the girl reacting to the things that other people are saying. The pricing incentives there come from competition. The girls who are most successful know how to make their men compete against each other to become like the highest status, the winner, the victor. You use competitive, masculine language when referring to them, like &#8216;Who's going to be my hero and like, rescue me from being the horny&#8217; or something.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong><em>laughs</em></p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> And so the guys get this feeling when they tip her that it's not just winning her, but winning her to the exclusion of other men and that's very visible and works really well. But with OnlyFans it's really fascinating because they've gotten entirely the opposite direction. They've completely removed the competitive aspect. They've slowly been removing it too, like you can't even see people's comments on videos anymore. Plus, DMs are huge and that feels so one on one. OnlyFans opens it up to men who don't feel like they can win a competition and the girl can make them feel as special as they want to feel with this one on one interaction.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Given how intimate this is, especially from the man's perspective, are they thinking of you as their girlfriend or is there almost new language that needs to be created for whatever this relationship is?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I think most men aren&#8217;t delusional about what the relationship is like. Most men do not actually think that you're their girlfriend, but I think that this ties into a misconception about what men want sexually. A lot of men are fine with a sex doll who is going suck their penis and let him cum in her ass, and they don't really care about her personality. That definitely does make up some men, but a huge amount of men are more aroused by somebody that they feel like they can personally access, and who they can personally influence and who approves of them. Men generally want to feel like a woman is pleased by their sexual presence, desires them, and enjoys them. The way that they get this is not really through watching pornography, which is extremely impersonal, and they can't participate in it, it's by giving a girl a little bit of money and then experiencing the joy of having her smile at you and her genuinely squealing because girls like getting money. Then you know that they're associating you with positive feelings and you're like, &#8216;Oh, that's awesome.&#8217;. Then you get to tip her to masturbate and it looks real, even though sometimes it's not. And then you're like, &#8216;Wow, I caused that. I gave this girl money. She's happy about it. And now she gets to pleasure herself like she probably really likes me.&#8217; That sort of feeling can be very addictive for a lot of men.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>What I find so fascinating is that it&#8217;s a total misconception that men just want sex. In fact, what they want is to feel a connection.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>Right, and I think that this is sort of inevitable because one, men are more sexually driven than women are more likely to engage in casual sex and all that stuff. And two there wasn't really a scalable way for men to consume sexual content from strangers with intimacy. So far, we had the porno magazines or porn sites online so there just hasn't been a method for men to express their desire even financially. When I first started doing sex work, I had no idea that men wanted intimacy because I had been fed this story by everybody around me that men just want tits and ass. I was genuinely surprised to find guys who seem to really care about me, and I developed genuine friendships with some of them.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I think that there's a stereotype in the world about who pays for sex work. And I would love it if you could tell us a little bit about the friendships that you've developed with some of your clients.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I think the deepest friendships I formed were through in-person escorting, which is my personal favorite form of sex work if you take the money out of it because you get a one on one interaction as opposed to one of many. A lot of guys expressed finding me because they wanted sex before they died.</p><p><strong>BW:</strong> Wow</p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> Some felt inadequate. Some were virgins and were really terrified that women wouldn't like them and they had no idea what to do. They figured, &#8216;OK, if I get an escort, I can learn how to please a woman.&#8217; These men desperately want to be valued by women. I had one guy who had the most profound impact on me. I met up with him in a hotel and we were talking and he said something and looked sad about it. He was talking about his life. That made me feel sad so I started crying and then he started crying. And then we just held each other and sobbed for a while. Then we took off our clothes and just had skin to skin contact. So we lay, intertwined, hugging and that was the entire session. It was just him needing to hold somebody who is accepting of his full body and just to sob. He said that he didn't have any other outlet like that. From then on he would hire me about once a month and I would come see him and he would just hold me and cry. Sometimes we would have sex and that was really part of it for him. It felt really good and fulfilling for me, like I felt like I was really helping him and I had quite a bit of empathy for him. I still think about him and I hope he's doing well to this day. Sex serves as this outlet that can be an access to a lot of deeper stuff that men very often have no other way of expressing or communicating to people.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>God, that's really touching. I want to go back to what you were saying about how he wasn't hungry for sex, he was hungry for touch, which is a really different thing. Was he single or was he in a sexless marriage, or a relationship?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>He was single. I got the impression that he was too depressed to maintain a relationship.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Are you feeling more like a therapist at that moment? What&#8217;s the role that you're playing for him?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>The closest would be a therapist because you're being paid for intimacy, but it can also be very genuine. I do feel actual love. I wouldn't say it's romantic, butterfly love, but I feel a great deal of compassion. I feel really cheesy saying this, but it&#8217;s like a sacred love. I felt like I was accessing a sacred love for them, even if it was constrained by our rules of life.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I'd love it if we could kind of go back in time to talk a bit about your upbringing.</p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> I was born into an evangelical household. My dad is a professional apologist who goes around debating people and writing books and telling people how Christianity is correct. We were homeschooled and I didn't know anybody else who wasn't homeschooled or wasn't raised in the same kind of program that we were. It was a program called Growing Kids God's Way, which is a pretty strict set of rules for how to treat your kids. I was very religious because I didn't know anything else, and my dad also had very good arguments for Christianity that were very convincing. I was personally pretty fanatical about it. I was an evangelical myself for a while. I was super repressed, super isolated from the world and our media was heavily filtered. I went to public school very briefly once when I was 14, until my parents figured out that I had Internet access and then they removed me from school so I couldn't access the computers. But I remember being totally unintegrated with the people at the public school. I had no idea what was going on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Did you have a TV in your house or radio? What kind of pop culture did you get in your house, if anything, at all?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>We had computers with restricted internet access. We also had this thing called a TV guardian that automatically detects any sort of swearing or nudity and it deletes those scenes from the movie you're watching. So I would watch movies, and then I would grow up and watch the movie again and be like, &#8216;What the fuck?&#8217; Like I watched &#8216;Titanic&#8217; with zero awareness that the two main characters were ever sexually involved. I didn't really know what sex was. So we did have media, it was just really strictly regulated.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>There was something that I read where you talked about working at a factory at one point, at what point did that happen in your life? Was that right after you left home?</p><p><strong>Aella:</strong>So I left home when I was 17 and I was still very religious. At that point I had ended up in a context where I was not surrounded by religious people. I was surrounded by atheists and they were surprisingly very nice. They were accepting and I think this sort of unlocked some part of my brain. I attempted to go to college and failed because I couldn't afford it and my parents would not help me financially. Because I couldn't afford it and my parents would not help me financially I had to work whatever job was available to me. The thing that was available was a factory job so I did that. I was on an assembly floor working six days a week, very long hours. There were no windows - it really sucked. I mean, this is really what drove me to become a sex worker is because I worked there for a year and then I had an opportunity for aphotography job that I went for, but it didn't work out. At that point I was kind of cut loose and thought&nbsp; &#8216;What do I want to do?&#8217; I could&#8217;ve gone back to the factory, but I&nbsp; just couldn't bring myself to do it. So I tried to do some various startups, which I was really inept at because I had no experience or and I was isolated from the world. I didn't understand culture. I was a really weird person. And then eventually somebody suggested camming to me. I was like, &#8216;OK, I guess I'll try that because it's not a factory.&#8217; I tried it and it did really well. And then that was the beginning of everything.</p><p><strong>BW</strong>: When did you adopt the name Aella?</p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> I don't think I've actually been asked that question before. I selected the name when I was becoming a camgirl. Pretty early on in my camming, I moved into a cam house with other girls and we didn&#8217;t want to accidently refer to each other with our real names when we were on cam.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Given that you had so little cultural context, like you thought &#8216;Titanic&#8217; was a movie about a boat sinking and not about Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, I'm curious about how you had any idea of what sexiness was? What did you think was sexy and how did you figure out how to make yourself into something that was sexy?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>It's a fantastic question. You are absolutely on point with the intuition that I had no idea. When I was a teenager, flirting was not allowed. I didn't know a single other kid who had had sex with or kissed anybody else. The concept of flirting was just not something in my wheelhouse. So when I started camming, I was probably the most awkward camgirl you've ever seen. I was very goofy. But goofy does not sell as well as genuine sex sells. So as I was working very hard to be creative and original, a lot of people were earning more money than me doing half the amount of work. And so over time I slowly figured out how to very consciously and manually change my body language to be the kind of woman that men wanted to see, which involves stuff like talking slower, using little words, having greater variance tone, smiling, and being really warm. I would figure out how to put on the girl persona in my shows, and then I started earning a lot more money.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>&nbsp;There's a lot of topics that your work touches that I feel personally torn about. There's so many topics in the world where I have such strident opinions, but when it comes to something like, let's say like plastic surgery, I feel genuinely torn. On the one hand I feel people should be natural, that aging is a normal part of life, and the idea that we should constantly be chasing youth and perkiness is unrealistic. On the other hand, I'm 37, and you talk about wanting to avoid the sag, and I'm living the sag. I can very much imagine myself wanting to get something done, even Botox, let's say, which I've avoided until now.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I might have a bit of an abnormal view on it. I sort of feel like my body is a tool and I'm not super attached to it, so I am open to taking whatever changes are beneficial to me, especially if they're reversible, like fillers. I really liked my face after I got a nose job. It wasn't a severe change. My nose was crooked. But I look in the mirror, and I feel more like myself, which is strange. But also the world is really not fair. The things that are sexually appealing are like 22 year olds who are very perky and we're never going to be able to match that again no matter how hard we try. It sucks and it's okay to want that and fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I want to pick up on what you just said about how sometimes things aren&#8217;t fair, but they can still be true. One of the things I just appreciate so much about you is that I think a lot of people, especially on places like Twitter, want to avoid saying what&#8217;s true because the truth is so fundamentally unfair. And one one of those things, I think, is the topic of gender and of gender difference and the idea differences between men and women are simply a social construct. And to my ears, what you're saying is that that's just not true, whether it's because of evolution, or whatever it is, that there are ways, in general, that men and women are just wired differently.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I mean, if the differences between men and women are a social construct, then I really need to reconsider what my concept of a social construct is, because they're way more powerful than I had previously thought. But I think it's unlikely that social constructs are more powerful than I previously thought. And I think it's more likely that gender is not fully a social construct. We need to define what we mean by gender. There are a lot of things that change throughout cultures and throughout time. So there are a lot of things that don't. And some things are kind of stable, like the fact that men are willing to give a lot more resources and effort in order to procure sex with women than vice versa. That seems to be sort of a universal truth.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the recent tragic shooting in March in Atlanta. You wrote this on Twitter, &#8220;It's infuriating. Sex workers are marginalized by society, prohibited from financial services, put in literal jail, often don't have another choice of employment. And when they get slaughtered, what happens? People focus on another common factor and pretend it was due to that. I am really enraged. Absolutely furious.&#8221;</p><p><strong>Aella:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>The common narrative about what happened in Atlanta was that because six of the eight people who were murdered by the shooter were Asian, that it was actually motivated by anti-American sentiment. But when you look at the actual story and the motivations of the killer, that doesn't really seem to be exactly the case.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>Even in recounting it, I could feel my body tensing up with righteous anger as you're going over it. It is really infuriating and&nbsp; it really changed the way that I view media reporting. It was extremely clear that this man was motivated by killing sex workers. He had struggled with sex addiction in the past, he made posts about how he didn't like being a sexual person. He was struggling with it. He went and he shot up places that he had frequented with an explicit motivation to help other people with sexual addiction, and he also explicitly said &#8216;This isn't racist. There isn&#8217;t a racial motivation. This is like like specifically sex.&#8217; So like you feel like, OK, if this guy has this specific motivation and the people that he's shooting like match exactly the motivation that he's talking about, you would think that we would hear about that in the media. Some sources did talk about it but a lot of people that I talked to about it had no idea that the people he shot up were sex worked. They thought it was a hate crime, and I'm not saying that there aren't hate crimes against Asians or that it's not increasing. It&#8217;s a valid thing to talk about. But the facts of the situation were so misrepresented, so blatantly, and I felt like my brain shut down. I can't even comprehend the lack of motivation to discover and report the truth that everybody who's having a conversation around this must have. People just must not care.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>It kind of reminds me, going back to the parental guidelines that your parents had on your television to filter out the inconvenient scenes in the movies that you wanted to watch. The press in a way, did the same thing in this story. They filtered out the inconvenient truth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>Well, I think it's because the convenient one sells better. Like right now, racism, while it is real and has problems that I'm not trying to say that this is not serious, it&#8217;s also a selling point. It's marketable. If you can pin something on racism, this is something that people are going to want to engage with much more because everybody can relate to it. All of the white people want to feel like they're being good and useful and helpful to Asians, and all of the Asians can be like, wow, this relates to me personally. With sex workers, they're like a tiny minority and a lot of people actively dislike them or would think that maybe they had it coming to them. It&#8217;s not something that you can connect with personally, the sex worker thing so we went with the convenient, sellable one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>The tendency to push people into good or bad or pure impure that I think Critical Race Theory is pushing people into and often the legacy media narrative is pushing people into, does that remind you in any way to how you grew up?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>Yeah, it does. It absolutely does. It's eerie. It's very unsettling. I thought that I was leaving religion and I wasn&#8217;t going to have to have to deal with this anymore. This was sort of the defining thing between being religious and not being religious. It felt like I went from a position of knowing what's going on to I don't know what's going on. Christianity gave me a very clear, concrete thing I could hold on to as an answer to all of my questions. Moving to atheism was terrifying because it was like, &#8216;Well, I don't know.&#8217; I noticed I was no longer necessarily attached to what I had to believe. As a Christian, I had to be attached. Things were there to be defended. There was a war against people who were not Christian and if somebody presented a criticism of the Bible, like a contradiction or something that didn&#8217;t line up historically, or &#8216;Why does this happen?&#8217; I came at those questions not as, &#8216;Oh, that is interesting. Let's find out.&#8217; I came to the question with the attitude of &#8216;I know what the answer must be, and I'm going to figure out a way to answer your question such that it leads to my answer.&#8217; Obviously this was not conscious. I was not having these literal thoughts as I was answering questions. This was just sort of built very quietly into the background to how I processed information and addressed criticism and concerns. The difference between Christianity and atheism for me was not one of the concrete beliefs, but rather the defensiveness that we used. There was very little defensiveness with atheism and with Christianity there was a lot. When it comes to the CRT thing, I am seeing the exact same sort of defensiveness that I saw among Christians. Questions or criticisms or curiosities are not neutral; they're not sort of thrown out in the room that people can circle at and kind of figure out together what the answer is. If you ask somebody who believes in these questions, like they come at it from the background, that, &#8216;Oh, this is an attack that must be defended against. And there is only one possible answer. And if it deviates from the answer, then it must necessarily be incorrect in some way.&#8217; That really makes me feel terrified and gross and very averse to all of it. I do not want any more of that in my life.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>The other thing that seems very, very connected beyond the defensiveness and beyond wanting to put people in boxes is the use of shame as a tool to make people kind of fall in line and shaming others just seems to be such a dominant mode in so much of our culture right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>Hmmm.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>&nbsp;It's like you can leave religion behind and yet there is something maybe deep within us that feels shame about ourselves or maybe that wants to shame others. It connects also to me, to the shooter in Atlanta, you know, that that kind of violence is driven by that same shame. Unless you find a way to harness shame, which maybe is a natural part of who we are, it can go in really dark directions.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>It's also really sad. I absolutely agree with you that this is something that we sort of have and maybe it's being harnessed or weaponized by these sorts of ideas. It's also just really sad because in order to feel shame, you have to reject some part of yourself. You have to have this sort of mental movement where you have a belief about yourself and this belief is unacceptable in some way. It is an indication of some fundamental flaw, something being seared from reality. The Christians talk about it with sin, like you have fallen from grace. It's this metaphysical, magical belief that something in you is not as it ought to be with the ought being word that's doing a lot of work. It just tears people apart. I'm so distraught, by the way, that a lot of culture seems to be deliberately creating shame in people. It works by weaponizing that shame because shame is an avenue of control. Not only is that like controlling people, it's sort of doing it by causing people to be less self accepting. And I think this is probably exacerbating a lot of mental health issues. I feel such compassion and grief for the people who are victims of this.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So just tying it a little bit back to where we began, which is your work and speaking of shame. Is what is happening on platforms like OnlyFans, is it helping us fight maybe shame or loneliness or repressed sexuality? Or are platforms that allow us to be even more alone in our rooms, in front of our screens, hurting us and driving us deeper into those maladies? That is sort of my ultimate question for you as someone who is so focused on helping people get over shame and come to accept themselves. Is this very platform or platforms like it hurting or helping?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I mean,like most things, the answer is probably both. I think it is hurting some people and helping others. But I feel like this is a symptom, or a Band-Aid on a deeper problem. And the answer is not like, &#8216;Well is this the Band-Aid that we're using for it good or bad.&#8217; The question should be about the wound underneath it. That's the real thing. I think the idea of banning OnlyFans would be really harmful to the world, even if OnlyFans itself might be creating harm. I think that banning it would be creating even greater harm. So we have to really evaluate what the trade offs are. The underlying thing is that men don't have a clear path in their personal lives to find sexual acceptance from women. That is a really hard problem to solve and it's a very ancient problem. I'm not necessarily saying there's obviously something we should do, but that is the core issue here. Men are finding the outlet that they can. They're finding the relief and the peace that is available to them, and I think it would be incredibly cruel to deny that to them. Again, that relief does not necessarily mean that it's the most healthy thing to do.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I would love to hear a little bit more from you about what you think is perpetuating this wound.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I might need to be vague and say that I think men don't have a role. The role for men has been becoming increasingly unclear. Men are now earning fewer college degrees than women and yet are still expected to be the strong provider in some ways. When it comes to gender roles, the thing that men provide is typically protection, and the thing that women provide is typically reproduction. We no longer need protection, but we still need reproduction, so it's like, &#8216;What do men do? Why are they valuable? Why are they even here?&#8217; It&#8217;s kind of the ambient question in the background. Women still have to do all this stuff, but what the fuck are men good for? Impregnating and running? I'm not saying there's an answer. I'm not giving a simple quick fix. I feel like this is the thing that we're going to have to figure out how to grapple with as a culture, because with any sort of advancement in a culture, we&#8217;re going to run into this problem where the role of one gender becomes unnecessary faster than the role of the other. This creates an imbalance in value.I think the imbalance in value ultimately is the thing that's contributing to this sort of thing where women are able to rake in huge amounts of cash online while men are like sitting alone in their basements watching.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>When I look at my own life progressive politics and feminism and gay rights gave me my life and gave me unbelievable freedom. I'm able to work and live and make money like men historically were only able to do. Feminism let me win, but by letting women win, has it sort of made men lose?</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>I think that might be the case. Often when people say, &#8216;Oh, this movement has bad effects,&#8217; we have an urge to be like, well, we should not have that movement. But I think the question is, again, a harm tradeoff. Feminism had a lot of really awful side effects. I still think it is better than not having feminism. We have moved our problems over into a different sphere and I think overall they're less bad. I think we need to figure out more ways of solving the problems that we have created with feminism. I don't think that we should go back to the way things were before.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Aella, it has been an absolute pleasure. I've loved following you on Twitter for so long and I love the chance to go deep with you. And next time you're in L.A., I'd love to have you over for dinner.</p><p><strong>Aella: </strong>Absolutely. Thank you. </p><p></p><iframe class=\"spotify-wrap podcast\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8aff54a2685c393dc9ee6788d1&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;America's Sex Recession&quot;,&quot;subtitle&quot;:&quot;By Bari Weiss&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Podcast episode&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/50q2Ff1ysf8lXT0XXQJEUb&quot;}\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/50q2Ff1ysf8lXT0XXQJEUb\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>","content:encodedSnippet":"a.image2.image-link.image2-525-700 {\n            padding-bottom: 75%;\n            padding-bottom: min(75%, 525px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-525-700 img {\n            max-width: 700px;\n            max-height: 525px;\n          }\n        \n\nWe are all walking around with a hunk of glass in our pockets that allows us to swipe right and find a hook-up within 100 feet. Or to swipe right and find someone who might pay us for a picture of our feet. Or to swipe right and, maybe, find our spouse. \nGiven this technological miracle, you’d think we’d be living in a state of constant bliss with marriages and birth rates through the roof. Not so much.\nA recent study from the American Medical Association found that one third of men between the ages of 18 to 24 reported having no sex at all in the previous year -- and that was before the COVID lockdowns. A Pew study from last year showed that half of American singles aren’t even looking for a relationship, or even looking to go on dates. That lack of interest is also reflected in the marriage rate and the birth rate, which are both at historic lows.\nWhat’s at a historic high is online porn.\nIn 2019, more than five billion hours of porn were watched just on Pornhub alone. That’s more than 500,000 years worth of time.\nMy guest today has been at the forefront of this change. \nAella has been doing sex work online and in real life for the past decade. She’s now killing on a platform called OnlyFans, where she and others charge for their explicit content.\nI first discovered Aella on Twitter where I was struck by her curiosity and her heterodox politics. If you don’t follow her, I highly recommend it.\nWhatever preconceptions you have about porn stars or sex work, I am confident she will challenge them.\nWithout further ado, here’s an edited version of my conversation with Aella:\nBW: For people who aren’t super online, how do you explain to them what you do for work?\nAella: It varies depending on the person, but maybe the basic way of putting it is like: a nude Facebook. It’s like if you had to pay money to be a Facebook friend with somebody, and then they post nudes and porn on their page. \nBW: Can you give us a little bit of a sense of how long you've been in the field that you're in?\nAella: I got into sex work almost ten years ago now. I can't believe it's been that long. I started with camming. I don't know if you watch Twitch, but it's like a nude-y Twitch. It’s like broadcasting from a TV, but then you can chat to them with your keyboard. I did that for about five years, took a break, and then I got into escorting. So, IRL I would meet up with men and then have sex with them.\nBW: And why did you go from the world of camming, which seems far more convenient and I would imagine safer, to real life escorting?\nAella: I got burned out from camming. It was really exhausting. It's basically like being a lifestream improv comedian/entertainer/really hot for around two to three hours every day. In one small study I did with camgirls, I found that the hourly amount that you made was very correlated to the total amount of hours that you put in. The more hours you work, the more money you make per hour. It's also very competitive. The ranking -- which is based on how much money you earn per hour averaged over the last 60 days -- is on the front page which affects your income a lot because that is how men find you. If you log on and you do a live stream and nobody tips you for an hour it’s stressful, not just because you're wasting your time, but because this is actively adversely impacting your ranking on the page. It can be a really stressful experience because it's a snowball in both directions. After about five years of having to do these live performances I just couldn't bring myself to do it anymore. And then I quit and went into crypto for a bit. And after working there, I figured I wanted more money. \nBW: laughs\nAella: I had a friend who was an escort and I'd always kind of known that this was a thing I could potentially get into. But at one point I was like, OK, I need to actually start working for myself again, for a world that I own and control because working for somebody else's company was really unpleasant. And so I did a call, and she sort of told me the basics; how to stay safe, and how to advertise. And then I went from there and became a high-end escort pretty quickly. And I did that for about a year and a half. Then after COVID hit, it made it a little bit awkward to be meeting with men who are mostly older and probably very at risk of getting sick. I didn't want to accidentally kill anybody, so I switched to OnlyFans, which was starting to boom at that point. That's what I've been doing since.\nBW: I’m wondering if you can walk me through what an average day in your professional life looks like.\nAella: So the day varies a lot, but often when I wake up, I’ll check my OnlyFans to see how I did overnight, and see how many likes I got from my posts on Reddit. Reddit is a content aggregator. You can post things there and if people like them, they upvote them and they go to the top and there's groups that are ‘Not Safe For Work’. A big source of subscribers for people on OnlyFans is posting to the NSFW subreddits, so I automate those posts. I schedule them in advance because certain times are better to post than others because they're more likely to get more views.\nBW: Are those posts like essentially marketing for your OnlyFans?\nAella: Yes. Probably 20 percent of my actual work is spent inside of OnlyFans producing content for OnlyFans. When I take content, I take a bunch of photos of myself, mostly selfies in various states of undress. I will take a couple of those photos and some short videos, gifs, and I will pull them out and have those be my marketing section. So typically they're not explicit. I save the explicit stuff for my OnlyFans. I have specific angles of labia that I'm willing to show in public versus through the locked paywall. And so I take the ones that fit the correct criteria and then I put them into circulation for my marketing thing, so I post them on Reddit or on Twitter. I have a NSFW group on Telegram, too, so all of these photos will get circulated through that cycle.\nBW: Got it. OK, so that's first thing in the morning. You're seeing how that did overnight. And then what comes next?\nAella: I’ll catch up on messages a little bit. So people will have DM-ed me, and sometimes they attach tips when they message you. And then around 3 or 4 I will shoot some videos or photos. I typically try and get like a couple every day. So I’ll take an hour and knock out a little bit of photos, short videos of me, like bouncing or dancing or teasing really heavily. Some days, not always, instead of doing this, I will film a porno. I usually go on PornHub, look at the top ranked videos for this week and I pick one that I can replicate. And I use that as a template to do myself so that I don't have to actually have to think of an original creative porn to do. I pick something I know works and then I do that. I sell that porn through DMS. So I mass message this video into the DMS of people following me, which means that they get a locked box and a description of the video and if they click the box, then they will unlock it. They have to pay, so I select a price, and then I get eighty percent of everything they pay.\nBW: In a sense this is the oldest profession in the world, but what makes it feel different to me is the personalization aspect. Let's say I slid into your DMS on Twitter or I found a way to write to you on OnlyFans, and I asked you for a picture of your boobs just for me. Could I get that picture that's just made for me? And is there a difference between the pricing for that and the, let's say, the boob picture that 100 people are getting?\nAella: I mean, this is kind of philosophical. Are the boobs truly the same boobs? Is the digital photo unique? But, yes, you can ask for a unique photo and oftentimes people will ask for some sort of sign with the photo or a video of you saying their name. It's very common for girls to sell unique things that aren't unique because it's in DMs, so nobody else could see what anybody else is getting. If someone asks for a boob photo, you coulf pull any random boob photo that you have saved, so often people ask for some sort of verification.  \nBW: What I find interesting is that I think the narrative around porn and sex work is just that people want tits and ass, but actually what they want is the exclusivity to feel like you're giving something that's just made for them.\nAella: Oh, yeah. I think that this is why OnlyFans has skyrocketed so much. A lot of people are very confused about it. I could be rationalizing in hindsight, but it's really interesting the comparison between the way that camming works and OnlyFans. On camming, you're kind of in a community of men who are watching this woman because you can see everything that everybody else is saying, and you are there to witness the girl reacting to the things that other people are saying. The pricing incentives there come from competition. The girls who are most successful know how to make their men compete against each other to become like the highest status, the winner, the victor. You use competitive, masculine language when referring to them, like ‘Who's going to be my hero and like, rescue me from being the horny’ or something. \nBW: laughs\nAella: And so the guys get this feeling when they tip her that it's not just winning her, but winning her to the exclusion of other men and that's very visible and works really well. But with OnlyFans it's really fascinating because they've gotten entirely the opposite direction. They've completely removed the competitive aspect. They've slowly been removing it too, like you can't even see people's comments on videos anymore. Plus, DMs are huge and that feels so one on one. OnlyFans opens it up to men who don't feel like they can win a competition and the girl can make them feel as special as they want to feel with this one on one interaction.\nBW: Given how intimate this is, especially from the man's perspective, are they thinking of you as their girlfriend or is there almost new language that needs to be created for whatever this relationship is?\nAella: I think most men aren’t delusional about what the relationship is like. Most men do not actually think that you're their girlfriend, but I think that this ties into a misconception about what men want sexually. A lot of men are fine with a sex doll who is going suck their penis and let him cum in her ass, and they don't really care about her personality. That definitely does make up some men, but a huge amount of men are more aroused by somebody that they feel like they can personally access, and who they can personally influence and who approves of them. Men generally want to feel like a woman is pleased by their sexual presence, desires them, and enjoys them. The way that they get this is not really through watching pornography, which is extremely impersonal, and they can't participate in it, it's by giving a girl a little bit of money and then experiencing the joy of having her smile at you and her genuinely squealing because girls like getting money. Then you know that they're associating you with positive feelings and you're like, ‘Oh, that's awesome.’. Then you get to tip her to masturbate and it looks real, even though sometimes it's not. And then you're like, ‘Wow, I caused that. I gave this girl money. She's happy about it. And now she gets to pleasure herself like she probably really likes me.’ That sort of feeling can be very addictive for a lot of men.\nBW: What I find so fascinating is that it’s a total misconception that men just want sex. In fact, what they want is to feel a connection.\nAella: Right, and I think that this is sort of inevitable because one, men are more sexually driven than women are more likely to engage in casual sex and all that stuff. And two there wasn't really a scalable way for men to consume sexual content from strangers with intimacy. So far, we had the porno magazines or porn sites online so there just hasn't been a method for men to express their desire even financially. When I first started doing sex work, I had no idea that men wanted intimacy because I had been fed this story by everybody around me that men just want tits and ass. I was genuinely surprised to find guys who seem to really care about me, and I developed genuine friendships with some of them.\nBW: I think that there's a stereotype in the world about who pays for sex work. And I would love it if you could tell us a little bit about the friendships that you've developed with some of your clients.\nAella: I think the deepest friendships I formed were through in-person escorting, which is my personal favorite form of sex work if you take the money out of it because you get a one on one interaction as opposed to one of many. A lot of guys expressed finding me because they wanted sex before they died.\nBW: Wow\nAella: Some felt inadequate. Some were virgins and were really terrified that women wouldn't like them and they had no idea what to do. They figured, ‘OK, if I get an escort, I can learn how to please a woman.’ These men desperately want to be valued by women. I had one guy who had the most profound impact on me. I met up with him in a hotel and we were talking and he said something and looked sad about it. He was talking about his life. That made me feel sad so I started crying and then he started crying. And then we just held each other and sobbed for a while. Then we took off our clothes and just had skin to skin contact. So we lay, intertwined, hugging and that was the entire session. It was just him needing to hold somebody who is accepting of his full body and just to sob. He said that he didn't have any other outlet like that. From then on he would hire me about once a month and I would come see him and he would just hold me and cry. Sometimes we would have sex and that was really part of it for him. It felt really good and fulfilling for me, like I felt like I was really helping him and I had quite a bit of empathy for him. I still think about him and I hope he's doing well to this day. Sex serves as this outlet that can be an access to a lot of deeper stuff that men very often have no other way of expressing or communicating to people.\nBW: God, that's really touching. I want to go back to what you were saying about how he wasn't hungry for sex, he was hungry for touch, which is a really different thing. Was he single or was he in a sexless marriage, or a relationship?\nAella: He was single. I got the impression that he was too depressed to maintain a relationship. \nBW: Are you feeling more like a therapist at that moment? What’s the role that you're playing for him?\nAella: The closest would be a therapist because you're being paid for intimacy, but it can also be very genuine. I do feel actual love. I wouldn't say it's romantic, butterfly love, but I feel a great deal of compassion. I feel really cheesy saying this, but it’s like a sacred love. I felt like I was accessing a sacred love for them, even if it was constrained by our rules of life.\nBW: I'd love it if we could kind of go back in time to talk a bit about your upbringing.\nAella: I was born into an evangelical household. My dad is a professional apologist who goes around debating people and writing books and telling people how Christianity is correct. We were homeschooled and I didn't know anybody else who wasn't homeschooled or wasn't raised in the same kind of program that we were. It was a program called Growing Kids God's Way, which is a pretty strict set of rules for how to treat your kids. I was very religious because I didn't know anything else, and my dad also had very good arguments for Christianity that were very convincing. I was personally pretty fanatical about it. I was an evangelical myself for a while. I was super repressed, super isolated from the world and our media was heavily filtered. I went to public school very briefly once when I was 14, until my parents figured out that I had Internet access and then they removed me from school so I couldn't access the computers. But I remember being totally unintegrated with the people at the public school. I had no idea what was going on. \nBW: Did you have a TV in your house or radio? What kind of pop culture did you get in your house, if anything, at all?\nAella: We had computers with restricted internet access. We also had this thing called a TV guardian that automatically detects any sort of swearing or nudity and it deletes those scenes from the movie you're watching. So I would watch movies, and then I would grow up and watch the movie again and be like, ‘What the fuck?’ Like I watched ‘Titanic’ with zero awareness that the two main characters were ever sexually involved. I didn't really know what sex was. So we did have media, it was just really strictly regulated.\nBW: There was something that I read where you talked about working at a factory at one point, at what point did that happen in your life? Was that right after you left home?\nAella:So I left home when I was 17 and I was still very religious. At that point I had ended up in a context where I was not surrounded by religious people. I was surrounded by atheists and they were surprisingly very nice. They were accepting and I think this sort of unlocked some part of my brain. I attempted to go to college and failed because I couldn't afford it and my parents would not help me financially. Because I couldn't afford it and my parents would not help me financially I had to work whatever job was available to me. The thing that was available was a factory job so I did that. I was on an assembly floor working six days a week, very long hours. There were no windows - it really sucked. I mean, this is really what drove me to become a sex worker is because I worked there for a year and then I had an opportunity for aphotography job that I went for, but it didn't work out. At that point I was kind of cut loose and thought  ‘What do I want to do?’ I could’ve gone back to the factory, but I  just couldn't bring myself to do it. So I tried to do some various startups, which I was really inept at because I had no experience or and I was isolated from the world. I didn't understand culture. I was a really weird person. And then eventually somebody suggested camming to me. I was like, ‘OK, I guess I'll try that because it's not a factory.’ I tried it and it did really well. And then that was the beginning of everything.\nBW: When did you adopt the name Aella?\nAella: I don't think I've actually been asked that question before. I selected the name when I was becoming a camgirl. Pretty early on in my camming, I moved into a cam house with other girls and we didn’t want to accidently refer to each other with our real names when we were on cam.\nBW: Given that you had so little cultural context, like you thought ‘Titanic’ was a movie about a boat sinking and not about Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, I'm curious about how you had any idea of what sexiness was? What did you think was sexy and how did you figure out how to make yourself into something that was sexy?\nAella: It's a fantastic question. You are absolutely on point with the intuition that I had no idea. When I was a teenager, flirting was not allowed. I didn't know a single other kid who had had sex with or kissed anybody else. The concept of flirting was just not something in my wheelhouse. So when I started camming, I was probably the most awkward camgirl you've ever seen. I was very goofy. But goofy does not sell as well as genuine sex sells. So as I was working very hard to be creative and original, a lot of people were earning more money than me doing half the amount of work. And so over time I slowly figured out how to very consciously and manually change my body language to be the kind of woman that men wanted to see, which involves stuff like talking slower, using little words, having greater variance tone, smiling, and being really warm. I would figure out how to put on the girl persona in my shows, and then I started earning a lot more money.\nBW:  There's a lot of topics that your work touches that I feel personally torn about. There's so many topics in the world where I have such strident opinions, but when it comes to something like, let's say like plastic surgery, I feel genuinely torn. On the one hand I feel people should be natural, that aging is a normal part of life, and the idea that we should constantly be chasing youth and perkiness is unrealistic. On the other hand, I'm 37, and you talk about wanting to avoid the sag, and I'm living the sag. I can very much imagine myself wanting to get something done, even Botox, let's say, which I've avoided until now.\nAella: I might have a bit of an abnormal view on it. I sort of feel like my body is a tool and I'm not super attached to it, so I am open to taking whatever changes are beneficial to me, especially if they're reversible, like fillers. I really liked my face after I got a nose job. It wasn't a severe change. My nose was crooked. But I look in the mirror, and I feel more like myself, which is strange. But also the world is really not fair. The things that are sexually appealing are like 22 year olds who are very perky and we're never going to be able to match that again no matter how hard we try. It sucks and it's okay to want that and fail.  \nBW: I want to pick up on what you just said about how sometimes things aren’t fair, but they can still be true. One of the things I just appreciate so much about you is that I think a lot of people, especially on places like Twitter, want to avoid saying what’s true because the truth is so fundamentally unfair. And one one of those things, I think, is the topic of gender and of gender difference and the idea differences between men and women are simply a social construct. And to my ears, what you're saying is that that's just not true, whether it's because of evolution, or whatever it is, that there are ways, in general, that men and women are just wired differently.\nAella: I mean, if the differences between men and women are a social construct, then I really need to reconsider what my concept of a social construct is, because they're way more powerful than I had previously thought. But I think it's unlikely that social constructs are more powerful than I previously thought. And I think it's more likely that gender is not fully a social construct. We need to define what we mean by gender. There are a lot of things that change throughout cultures and throughout time. So there are a lot of things that don't. And some things are kind of stable, like the fact that men are willing to give a lot more resources and effort in order to procure sex with women than vice versa. That seems to be sort of a universal truth.\nBW: I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the recent tragic shooting in March in Atlanta. You wrote this on Twitter, “It's infuriating. Sex workers are marginalized by society, prohibited from financial services, put in literal jail, often don't have another choice of employment. And when they get slaughtered, what happens? People focus on another common factor and pretend it was due to that. I am really enraged. Absolutely furious.”\nAella: Yeah.\nBW: The common narrative about what happened in Atlanta was that because six of the eight people who were murdered by the shooter were Asian, that it was actually motivated by anti-American sentiment. But when you look at the actual story and the motivations of the killer, that doesn't really seem to be exactly the case.\nAella: Even in recounting it, I could feel my body tensing up with righteous anger as you're going over it. It is really infuriating and  it really changed the way that I view media reporting. It was extremely clear that this man was motivated by killing sex workers. He had struggled with sex addiction in the past, he made posts about how he didn't like being a sexual person. He was struggling with it. He went and he shot up places that he had frequented with an explicit motivation to help other people with sexual addiction, and he also explicitly said ‘This isn't racist. There isn’t a racial motivation. This is like like specifically sex.’ So like you feel like, OK, if this guy has this specific motivation and the people that he's shooting like match exactly the motivation that he's talking about, you would think that we would hear about that in the media. Some sources did talk about it but a lot of people that I talked to about it had no idea that the people he shot up were sex worked. They thought it was a hate crime, and I'm not saying that there aren't hate crimes against Asians or that it's not increasing. It’s a valid thing to talk about. But the facts of the situation were so misrepresented, so blatantly, and I felt like my brain shut down. I can't even comprehend the lack of motivation to discover and report the truth that everybody who's having a conversation around this must have. People just must not care.\nBW: It kind of reminds me, going back to the parental guidelines that your parents had on your television to filter out the inconvenient scenes in the movies that you wanted to watch. The press in a way, did the same thing in this story. They filtered out the inconvenient truth. \nAella: Well, I think it's because the convenient one sells better. Like right now, racism, while it is real and has problems that I'm not trying to say that this is not serious, it’s also a selling point. It's marketable. If you can pin something on racism, this is something that people are going to want to engage with much more because everybody can relate to it. All of the white people want to feel like they're being good and useful and helpful to Asians, and all of the Asians can be like, wow, this relates to me personally. With sex workers, they're like a tiny minority and a lot of people actively dislike them or would think that maybe they had it coming to them. It’s not something that you can connect with personally, the sex worker thing so we went with the convenient, sellable one. \nBW: The tendency to push people into good or bad or pure impure that I think Critical Race Theory is pushing people into and often the legacy media narrative is pushing people into, does that remind you in any way to how you grew up? \nAella: Yeah, it does. It absolutely does. It's eerie. It's very unsettling. I thought that I was leaving religion and I wasn’t going to have to have to deal with this anymore. This was sort of the defining thing between being religious and not being religious. It felt like I went from a position of knowing what's going on to I don't know what's going on. Christianity gave me a very clear, concrete thing I could hold on to as an answer to all of my questions. Moving to atheism was terrifying because it was like, ‘Well, I don't know.’ I noticed I was no longer necessarily attached to what I had to believe. As a Christian, I had to be attached. Things were there to be defended. There was a war against people who were not Christian and if somebody presented a criticism of the Bible, like a contradiction or something that didn’t line up historically, or ‘Why does this happen?’ I came at those questions not as, ‘Oh, that is interesting. Let's find out.’ I came to the question with the attitude of ‘I know what the answer must be, and I'm going to figure out a way to answer your question such that it leads to my answer.’ Obviously this was not conscious. I was not having these literal thoughts as I was answering questions. This was just sort of built very quietly into the background to how I processed information and addressed criticism and concerns. The difference between Christianity and atheism for me was not one of the concrete beliefs, but rather the defensiveness that we used. There was very little defensiveness with atheism and with Christianity there was a lot. When it comes to the CRT thing, I am seeing the exact same sort of defensiveness that I saw among Christians. Questions or criticisms or curiosities are not neutral; they're not sort of thrown out in the room that people can circle at and kind of figure out together what the answer is. If you ask somebody who believes in these questions, like they come at it from the background, that, ‘Oh, this is an attack that must be defended against. And there is only one possible answer. And if it deviates from the answer, then it must necessarily be incorrect in some way.’ That really makes me feel terrified and gross and very averse to all of it. I do not want any more of that in my life.\nBW: The other thing that seems very, very connected beyond the defensiveness and beyond wanting to put people in boxes is the use of shame as a tool to make people kind of fall in line and shaming others just seems to be such a dominant mode in so much of our culture right now. \nAella: Hmmm.\nBW:  It's like you can leave religion behind and yet there is something maybe deep within us that feels shame about ourselves or maybe that wants to shame others. It connects also to me, to the shooter in Atlanta, you know, that that kind of violence is driven by that same shame. Unless you find a way to harness shame, which maybe is a natural part of who we are, it can go in really dark directions.\nAella: It's also really sad. I absolutely agree with you that this is something that we sort of have and maybe it's being harnessed or weaponized by these sorts of ideas. It's also just really sad because in order to feel shame, you have to reject some part of yourself. You have to have this sort of mental movement where you have a belief about yourself and this belief is unacceptable in some way. It is an indication of some fundamental flaw, something being seared from reality. The Christians talk about it with sin, like you have fallen from grace. It's this metaphysical, magical belief that something in you is not as it ought to be with the ought being word that's doing a lot of work. It just tears people apart. I'm so distraught, by the way, that a lot of culture seems to be deliberately creating shame in people. It works by weaponizing that shame because shame is an avenue of control. Not only is that like controlling people, it's sort of doing it by causing people to be less self accepting. And I think this is probably exacerbating a lot of mental health issues. I feel such compassion and grief for the people who are victims of this.\nBW: So just tying it a little bit back to where we began, which is your work and speaking of shame. Is what is happening on platforms like OnlyFans, is it helping us fight maybe shame or loneliness or repressed sexuality? Or are platforms that allow us to be even more alone in our rooms, in front of our screens, hurting us and driving us deeper into those maladies? That is sort of my ultimate question for you as someone who is so focused on helping people get over shame and come to accept themselves. Is this very platform or platforms like it hurting or helping? \nAella: I mean,like most things, the answer is probably both. I think it is hurting some people and helping others. But I feel like this is a symptom, or a Band-Aid on a deeper problem. And the answer is not like, ‘Well is this the Band-Aid that we're using for it good or bad.’ The question should be about the wound underneath it. That's the real thing. I think the idea of banning OnlyFans would be really harmful to the world, even if OnlyFans itself might be creating harm. I think that banning it would be creating even greater harm. So we have to really evaluate what the trade offs are. The underlying thing is that men don't have a clear path in their personal lives to find sexual acceptance from women. That is a really hard problem to solve and it's a very ancient problem. I'm not necessarily saying there's obviously something we should do, but that is the core issue here. Men are finding the outlet that they can. They're finding the relief and the peace that is available to them, and I think it would be incredibly cruel to deny that to them. Again, that relief does not necessarily mean that it's the most healthy thing to do.\nBW: I would love to hear a little bit more from you about what you think is perpetuating this wound.\nAella: I might need to be vague and say that I think men don't have a role. The role for men has been becoming increasingly unclear. Men are now earning fewer college degrees than women and yet are still expected to be the strong provider in some ways. When it comes to gender roles, the thing that men provide is typically protection, and the thing that women provide is typically reproduction. We no longer need protection, but we still need reproduction, so it's like, ‘What do men do? Why are they valuable? Why are they even here?’ It’s kind of the ambient question in the background. Women still have to do all this stuff, but what the fuck are men good for? Impregnating and running? I'm not saying there's an answer. I'm not giving a simple quick fix. I feel like this is the thing that we're going to have to figure out how to grapple with as a culture, because with any sort of advancement in a culture, we’re going to run into this problem where the role of one gender becomes unnecessary faster than the role of the other. This creates an imbalance in value.I think the imbalance in value ultimately is the thing that's contributing to this sort of thing where women are able to rake in huge amounts of cash online while men are like sitting alone in their basements watching.  \nBW: When I look at my own life progressive politics and feminism and gay rights gave me my life and gave me unbelievable freedom. I'm able to work and live and make money like men historically were only able to do. Feminism let me win, but by letting women win, has it sort of made men lose?\nAella: I think that might be the case. Often when people say, ‘Oh, this movement has bad effects,’ we have an urge to be like, well, we should not have that movement. But I think the question is, again, a harm tradeoff. Feminism had a lot of really awful side effects. I still think it is better than not having feminism. We have moved our problems over into a different sphere and I think overall they're less bad. I think we need to figure out more ways of solving the problems that we have created with feminism. I don't think that we should go back to the way things were before. \nBW: Aella, it has been an absolute pleasure. I've loved following you on Twitter for so long and I love the chance to go deep with you. And next time you're in L.A., I'd love to have you over for dinner.\nAella: Absolutely.

The passengers &#8212; young men in keffiyehs, some draped to mask their faces &#8212; stand and shout through sunroofs and windows. The cars honk incessantly. In the back of a slow-moving Jeep, one man waves a billboard-sized Palestinian flag while another shouts through a megaphone: &#8220;Israel kills women and children every day!&#8221; His companions jeer: &#8220;Yeah! Fuck you!&#8221;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheMarieOakes/status/1395033297835761665\">next video</a> shows the same men on the sidewalk, shouting and advancing on another man in a grey shirt who&#8217;s trying to fend them off with a metal pedestal. In the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrtdogg_1/status/1395638918897360898\">next</a>: The man in grey is lying on the ground, curled in the fetal position. They punch him, kick him, claw at him.</p><p>The last <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eve_Barlow/status/1394899275578974213\">video</a> clip of the evening&#8217;s events shows the same sidewalk, now crowded with police. &#8220;They&#8217;re apparently going around the city, asking who&#8217;s Jewish, and beating them up,&#8221; says the unseen videographer. &#8220;This is America, guys.&#8221;</p><p>These clips were shot in late May, during the recent war between Israel and Hamas, a month in which there were dozens of similar attacks on Jews and Jewish spaces across America. It was also a moment when corporations and politicians &#8212;&nbsp; many of whom had eagerly released statements unequivocally condemning the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes the previous month, or supporting Black Lives Matter the previous year &#8212; suddenly lost their nerve when it came to denouncing violence against minorities.</p><p>Those that did speak out against Jew-hate, including high-profile progressives like Bernie Sanders and Ayanna Pressley, tended to speak out against &#8220;antisemitism and&#8221; &#8212; as in, antisemitism <em>and</em> Islamophobia, or antisemitism <em>and</em> all other forms of bigotry. (Tablet&#8217;s Noam Blum documented the trend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neontaster/status/1396651519521525762\">here</a>.)</p><p>So it made it particularly striking when one progressive literary organization came out against the violence and called it by its name.</p><p>The Society for Children&#8217;s Book Writers and Editors is an organization for established and aspiring professionals in children&#8217;s and young adult literature. The publishing industry is famously left-wing, but the world of children&#8217;s publishing makes the rest of the industry look like milquetoast moderates. In the past few years, Young Adult authors have rewritten already published work deemed offensive. They have seen the ratings of a not-yet-released book <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/entertainment/books/keira-drake-the-continent-book-comparisons/\">torpedoed</a> by organized takedown campaigns on Goodreads. They have <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/ya-twitter-forces-rising-star-author-to-self-cancel.html\">cancelled</a> their own titles after (often flimsy) allegations of racism, or been compelled to reveal <a href=\"https://www.metroweekly.com/2020/09/love-simon-author-becky-albertalli-comes-out-as-bisexual-after-criticism-over-books/\">private</a>, even traumatic details of their lives in order to &#8220;prove&#8221; that they have the standing to tell certain kinds of stories. In one particularly notorious case, Kirkus Reviews <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/american-heart-review-kirkus-editor-on-why-they-changed-it.html\">retracted</a> its starred review of the novel &#8220;American Heart&#8221; and issued a new one scolding its &#8220;problematic&#8221; elements after a Twitter outrage.&nbsp;</p><p>It was in that context that the Society for Children&#8217;s Book Writers and Editors <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SCBWI/photos/a.129189255298101/349922729891418\">put up a post</a> on Facebook that began: &#8220;The SCBWI unequivocally recognizes that the world&#8217;s 14.7 million Jewish people (less than 0.018% of the population) have the right to life, safety, and freedom from scapegoating and fear.&#8221; The June 10 post went on to condemn antisemitism as &#8220;one of the oldest forms of hatred,&#8221; and asked readers to &#8220;join us in not looking away.&#8221;</p><p>April Powers, the woman who wrote the post, is black and Jewish. And, as of last week, she is out of a job.</p><div><hr></div><p>Powers was hired last year as the society&#8217;s first &#8220;Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer,&#8221; a newly created position within the organization. She brought 15 years of experience to the role, having managed similar efforts at corporations like Nestle and Amgen. But she told me that she was unprepared for what happened after she posted that statement against antisemitism.&nbsp;</p><p>The saga began when one of the organization&#8217;s members, Razan Abdin-Adnani, who identified herself as the daughter of Palestinian refugees, commented on the post asking if the organization also planned to denounce violence against Palestinians.&nbsp;</p><p>Powers replied: &#8220;As a new member, you may not have noticed our statements are very recent &amp; reflect surges in hate crimes &amp; violence around the world. If we see a surge against Muslims globally as we have w/ other groups, expect us to speak out.&#8221;</p><p>In hindsight, Powers said she shouldn&#8217;t have engaged. &#8220;If I had it to do over again, I would have turned off comments for the statement,&#8221; she told me on Tuesday. &#8220;We were attempting to create a safe space.&#8221; She said she had no idea it would get so ugly so fast.</p><p>At first, Powers went back and forth with Abdin-Adnani in the comments. But when the conversation turned hostile and began attracting heated replies, she disengaged and deleted several comments, including some from Abdin-Adnani.</p><p>That&#8217;s when Abdin-Adnani took to Twitter. There, she repeatedly accused Powers and the organization of failing to show solidarity with Muslims and demanded a statement denouncing the violence in Gaza. She also demanded a refund of her membership dues, writing: &#8220;I had no idea this was a Zionist/politically motivated organization that doesn&#8217;t serve ALL children.&#8221;</p><p>The confirmation of her membership cancellation from an administrative assistant sparked additional offense: Apparently provoked by the assistant&#8217;s recognizably Jewish surname, Abdin-Adnani tweeted her dismay at receiving an email from &#8220;a white, Jewish woman who I noticed had a public FB picture of her in Israel.&#8221; She added: &#8220;as a Palestinian, it felt like a slap in the face.&#8221; (Abdin-Adnani later posted a screengrab of the email including the assistant&#8217;s full name.)&nbsp;</p><p>You might imagine that this would have been a good time for the organization to take a principled stand, to condemn this member's inappropriate behavior, and to make a strong statement in support of its employees, particularly its black, Jewish diversity chief.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, SCBWI stayed silent as the controversy continued to blow up online. Both Powers and the SCBWI account blocked Abdin-Adnani as her tweets got more intemperate, contributing to a narrative that she had been &#8220;silenced.&#8221; Big accounts on YA Twitter signal boosted her complaints. Prominent authors <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djolder/status/1408587054343147521\">demanded</a> apologies and vowed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ericsmithrocks/status/1408834928394047493\">boycotts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, two weeks after the original Facebook post, Lin Oliver, the executive director of SCBWI, offered a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SCBWI/photos/a.129189255298101/360657802151244\">groveling apology</a>. Not to the Jews, for failing to stand by a simple denunciation of antisemitism, nor to a faithful employee, whom SCBWI had left to twist in the wind, but to &#8220;everyone the Palestinian community who felt unrepresented, silenced, or marginalized.&#8221; The statement went on to acknowledge &#8220;the pain our actions have caused to our Muslim and Palestinian members&#8221; &#8212; pain brought on, it seems, by daring to oppose violence against Jews. &#8220;I also want to offer my apologies to Razan Abdin-Adnani for making her feel unseen and unheard by blocking her. She has been unblocked from our feed,&#8221; Oliver wrote. (Oliver and Abdin-Adnani did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>Although Powers insists that SCBWI did not compel her resignation, SCBWI happily took credit for it. The apology noted: &#8220;As a remedy to these events, we have taken some initial steps: 1. Effective immediately, we have accepted the resignation of April, our Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer.&#8221;</p><p>Toward the end of the organization&#8217;s apology was an abject note from Powers herself: &#8220;By posting an antisemitism statement, our intention was to stay out of politics. . . . I neglected to address the rise in Islamophobia, and deeply regret that omission. . . While this doesn&#8217;t fix the pain and disappointment that you feel by my mishandling of the moment, I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and resignation from the SCBWI.&#8221;</p><p>What began as a simple denunciation of antisemitism ended with a letter that reads like a hostage video.&nbsp;</p><p>Powers was painstakingly diplomatic in our conversation. She stressed to me that she bears no ill will toward her former employer, which she calls a &#8220;wonderful&#8221; organization, and that she resigned by choice. But did she have a viable alternative? As threats mounted against Powers, her family, and her colleagues, SCBWI could have condemned her attackers and stood by her. It didn&#8217;t. And Powers said she wasn&#8217;t about to stick around just to see how much worse things would get.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;I was terrorized online,&#8221; she told me. &#8220;I&#8217;m still receiving horrible messages. I wasn&#8217;t willing to endure that for any job.&#8221;</p><p>What disturbs Powers the most wasn&#8217;t the harassment or the threats. It&#8217;s that when she tried to do the job she was hired to do her Jewishness was seen as inherently suspect &#8212; and, for some, as a reason to discredit her. &#8220;It was, &#8216;You&#8217;re Jewish, you can&#8217;t be in a role like this,&#8217;&#8221;&nbsp; she said. &#8220;I lost credibility in that exchange because I'm Jewish.&#8221;</p><p>When it comes to the original statement, she says she has no regrets. &#8220;I will not apologize for making a statement on antisemitism. It needed to be said and it still needs to be said. The silence is deafening.&#8221;</p><div><hr></div><p>On one level, this is a story about a disturbed person who hijacked a small organization and leveraged the YA community&#8217;s penchant for petty drama to elevate a perceived slight into an industry-wide outrage. It&#8217;s also something far bigger and more chilling.</p><p>What happened to April Powers demonstrates how high-minded ideals about intersectionality and social justice now operate in practice. Jews are not seen as a marginalized group in need of protection, nor as the victims of violence fueled by bigotry, or even as voices worth listening to on the topic of antisemitic hate. In a culture obsessed with locating every group in a hierarchy of oppression, Jews simply <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Untitled-David-Baddiel/dp/0008399476\">do not count</a>.</p><p>According to the tenets of social justice, Powers&#8217;s lived experience and multiple minority status should have made her unassailable on the topic of her own people&#8217;s oppression, and anyone who tried to use Powers&#8217;s identity to discredit her should have been roundly condemned. According to the tenets of social justice, the continuing violence &#8212; vandalism, harassment, a rabbi <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/07/04/metro/if-people-want-see-miracle-they-should-look-me-rabbi-who-survived-attack-says/\">stabbed</a> in broad daylight just the other day &#8212; means that we should be listening to the community now more than ever. But when that community is Jewish, progressives suddenly have very different ideas about who deserves to be heard.&nbsp;</p><p>For the moment, at least, Jews are Schrodinger&#8217;s victims; they may or may not be deserving of sympathy, depending on who&#8217;s doing the victimizing. When a group of tiki torch-wielding white nationalists chant &#8220;Jews will not replace us!,&#8221; the condemnation is swift.

Her bailiwick is our culture, particularly the strange corners of it that tend to go overlooked by everyone else. \nExhibit A is her ongoing, insightful coverage of the mad world of Young Adult fiction and the moral panics that regularly tend to convulse that industry.\nLast week that beat converged with the urgent story of rising Jew-hate in America when a black, Jewish diversity chief named April Powers lost her job in children’s publishing for condemning antisemitism. (You read that right.)\nWhen I came across the story, I immediately reached out to Kat to ask her what it said about the state of the publishing world and, more, what it revealed about how high-minded ideals like intersectionality actually operate in practice.                                \n                                                                                                                                       — BW\n\n\n\nOn first viewing, it looked like a Tik-Tok riff on The Purge: a caravan of cars rolls down La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles. The passengers — young men in keffiyehs, some draped to mask their faces — stand and shout through sunroofs and windows. The cars honk incessantly. In the back of a slow-moving Jeep, one man waves a billboard-sized Palestinian flag while another shouts through a megaphone: “Israel kills women and children every day!” His companions jeer: “Yeah! Fuck you!”\nThe next video shows the same men on the sidewalk, shouting and advancing on another man in a grey shirt who’s trying to fend them off with a metal pedestal. In the next: The man in grey is lying on the ground, curled in the fetal position. They punch him, kick him, claw at him.\nThe last video clip of the evening’s events shows the same sidewalk, now crowded with police. “They’re apparently going around the city, asking who’s Jewish, and beating them up,” says the unseen videographer. “This is America, guys.”\nThese clips were shot in late May, during the recent war between Israel and Hamas, a month in which there were dozens of similar attacks on Jews and Jewish spaces across America. It was also a moment when corporations and politicians —  many of whom had eagerly released statements unequivocally condemning the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes the previous month, or supporting Black Lives Matter the previous year — suddenly lost their nerve when it came to denouncing violence against minorities.\nThose that did speak out against Jew-hate, including high-profile progressives like Bernie Sanders and Ayanna Pressley, tended to speak out against “antisemitism and” — as in, antisemitism and Islamophobia, or antisemitism and all other forms of bigotry. (Tablet’s Noam Blum documented the trend here.)\nSo it made it particularly striking when one progressive literary organization came out against the violence and called it by its name.\nThe Society for Children’s Book Writers and Editors is an organization for established and aspiring professionals in children’s and young adult literature. The publishing industry is famously left-wing, but the world of children’s publishing makes the rest of the industry look like milquetoast moderates. In the past few years, Young Adult authors have rewritten already published work deemed offensive. They have seen the ratings of a not-yet-released book torpedoed by organized takedown campaigns on Goodreads. They have cancelled their own titles after (often flimsy) allegations of racism, or been compelled to reveal private, even traumatic details of their lives in order to “prove” that they have the standing to tell certain kinds of stories. In one particularly notorious case, Kirkus Reviews retracted its starred review of the novel “American Heart” and issued a new one scolding its “problematic” elements after a Twitter outrage. \nIt was in that context that the Society for Children’s Book Writers and Editors put up a post on Facebook that began: “The SCBWI unequivocally recognizes that the world’s 14.7 million Jewish people (less than 0.018% of the population) have the right to life, safety, and freedom from scapegoating and fear.” The June 10 post went on to condemn antisemitism as “one of the oldest forms of hatred,” and asked readers to “join us in not looking away.”\nApril Powers, the woman who wrote the post, is black and Jewish. And, as of last week, she is out of a job.\n\n\nPowers was hired last year as the society’s first “Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer,” a newly created position within the organization. She brought 15 years of experience to the role, having managed similar efforts at corporations like Nestle and Amgen. But she told me that she was unprepared for what happened after she posted that statement against antisemitism. \nThe saga began when one of the organization’s members, Razan Abdin-Adnani, who identified herself as the daughter of Palestinian refugees, commented on the post asking if the organization also planned to denounce violence against Palestinians. \nPowers replied: “As a new member, you may not have noticed our statements are very recent & reflect surges in hate crimes & violence around the world. If we see a surge against Muslims globally as we have w/ other groups, expect us to speak out.”\nIn hindsight, Powers said she shouldn’t have engaged. “If I had it to do over again, I would have turned off comments for the statement,” she told me on Tuesday. “We were attempting to create a safe space.” She said she had no idea it would get so ugly so fast.\nAt first, Powers went back and forth with Abdin-Adnani in the comments. But when the conversation turned hostile and began attracting heated replies, she disengaged and deleted several comments, including some from Abdin-Adnani.\nThat’s when Abdin-Adnani took to Twitter. There, she repeatedly accused Powers and the organization of failing to show solidarity with Muslims and demanded a statement denouncing the violence in Gaza. She also demanded a refund of her membership dues, writing: “I had no idea this was a Zionist/politically motivated organization that doesn’t serve ALL children.”\nThe confirmation of her membership cancellation from an administrative assistant sparked additional offense: Apparently provoked by the assistant’s recognizably Jewish surname, Abdin-Adnani tweeted her dismay at receiving an email from “a white, Jewish woman who I noticed had a public FB picture of her in Israel.” She added: “as a Palestinian, it felt like a slap in the face.” (Abdin-Adnani later posted a screengrab of the email including the assistant’s full name.) \nYou might imagine that this would have been a good time for the organization to take a principled stand, to condemn this member's inappropriate behavior, and to make a strong statement in support of its employees, particularly its black, Jewish diversity chief. \nInstead, SCBWI stayed silent as the controversy continued to blow up online. Both Powers and the SCBWI account blocked Abdin-Adnani as her tweets got more intemperate, contributing to a narrative that she had been “silenced.” Big accounts on YA Twitter signal boosted her complaints. Prominent authors demanded apologies and vowed boycotts. \nThen, two weeks after the original Facebook post, Lin Oliver, the executive director of SCBWI, offered a groveling apology. Not to the Jews, for failing to stand by a simple denunciation of antisemitism, nor to a faithful employee, whom SCBWI had left to twist in the wind, but to “everyone the Palestinian community who felt unrepresented, silenced, or marginalized.” The statement went on to acknowledge “the pain our actions have caused to our Muslim and Palestinian members” — pain brought on, it seems, by daring to oppose violence against Jews. “I also want to offer my apologies to Razan Abdin-Adnani for making her feel unseen and unheard by blocking her. She has been unblocked from our feed,” Oliver wrote. (Oliver and Abdin-Adnani did not respond to requests for comment.)\nAlthough Powers insists that SCBWI did not compel her resignation, SCBWI happily took credit for it. The apology noted: “As a remedy to these events, we have taken some initial steps: 1. Effective immediately, we have accepted the resignation of April, our Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer.”\nToward the end of the organization’s apology was an abject note from Powers herself: “By posting an antisemitism statement, our intention was to stay out of politics. . . . I neglected to address the rise in Islamophobia, and deeply regret that omission. . . While this doesn’t fix the pain and disappointment that you feel by my mishandling of the moment, I hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and resignation from the SCBWI.”\nWhat began as a simple denunciation of antisemitism ended with a letter that reads like a hostage video. \nPowers was painstakingly diplomatic in our conversation. She stressed to me that she bears no ill will toward her former employer, which she calls a “wonderful” organization, and that she resigned by choice. But did she have a viable alternative? As threats mounted against Powers, her family, and her colleagues, SCBWI could have condemned her attackers and stood by her. It didn’t. And Powers said she wasn’t about to stick around just to see how much worse things would get. \n“I was terrorized online,” she told me. “I’m still receiving horrible messages. I wasn’t willing to endure that for any job.”\nWhat disturbs Powers the most wasn’t the harassment or the threats. It’s that when she tried to do the job she was hired to do her Jewishness was seen as inherently suspect — and, for some, as a reason to discredit her. “It was, ‘You’re Jewish, you can’t be in a role like this,’”  she said. “I lost credibility in that exchange because I'm Jewish.”\nWhen it comes to the original statement, she says she has no regrets. “I will not apologize for making a statement on antisemitism. It needed to be said and it still needs to be said. The silence is deafening.”\n\n\nOn one level, this is a story about a disturbed person who hijacked a small organization and leveraged the YA community’s penchant for petty drama to elevate a perceived slight into an industry-wide outrage. It’s also something far bigger and more chilling.\nWhat happened to April Powers demonstrates how high-minded ideals about intersectionality and social justice now operate in practice. Jews are not seen as a marginalized group in need of protection, nor as the victims of violence fueled by bigotry, or even as voices worth listening to on the topic of antisemitic hate. In a culture obsessed with locating every group in a hierarchy of oppression, Jews simply do not count.\nAccording to the tenets of social justice, Powers’s lived experience and multiple minority status should have made her unassailable on the topic of her own people’s oppression, and anyone who tried to use Powers’s identity to discredit her should have been roundly condemned. According to the tenets of social justice, the continuing violence — vandalism, harassment, a rabbi stabbed in broad daylight just the other day — means that we should be listening to the community now more than ever. But when that community is Jewish, progressives suddenly have very different ideas about who deserves to be heard. \nFor the moment, at least, Jews are Schrodinger’s victims; they may or may not be deserving of sympathy, depending on who’s doing the victimizing. When a group of tiki torch-wielding white nationalists chant “Jews will not replace us!,” the condemnation is swift. But replace the tiki torch with a Palestinian flag, and call the Jews “settler colonialists,” and the equivocations roll in: Maybe that guy who threw a firebomb at a group of innocent people on the street in New York was punching up, actually? \nApril Powers naively believed that American Jews should get the same full-throated defense as any other minority group in the wake of a vicious attack, without ambivalence, caveats and whataboutism. That belief cost her the security of a job.\nIn the words of that unseen videographer: This is America, guys.\n\n\nIf you appreciate what we’re doing but haven’t yet chipped in, we’d be so grateful for your support:\nSubscribe now","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe67c94d0-a25c-4c3f-a70e-ca2815c4a5c2_853x1280.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Kat Rosenfield","content":"The inclusion officer's identity as a black Jew should have made her unassailable.

(Sergione Infuso/Corbis via Getty Images)\nLate last week, I was sitting in my kitchen when I read an essay that made me stand up and cheer. \nIt was written by Winston Marshall, who, before last week, was the banjo player and lead guitarist of Mumford & Sons. It was a gig he’d had for the past decade and a half.\nIf you’ve never heard of the band, go listen. But suffice it to say, it was a runaway success.

Why risk enduring the same thing again?\nSo I wasn’t only struck by the courage Marshall displayed in his essay, but by his willingness to risk speaking with me even while he is so clearly still in the midst of it. \nEarlier this week we sat down for a wide-ranging conversation. We talk about his faith, about self-censorship in the music industry, and about what it means to have moral courage. We also talk about Jordan Peterson, Kanye West, Vaclav Havel, Winston Churchill, and more. \nWe’ve heard you loud and clear about wanting options, so we’re giving you three: video, audio and print.\nHere is the video. You’ll have to excuse the somewhat janky set-up (my laptop camera). Starting in August, we’ll be moving out of our rental into a house of our very own and, ultimately, a studio in the backyard to go along with it:\n\nIf you prefer to listen, which I always do, click play right here:\n\nAnd for an edited and condensed version of our talk, just click right here. \n\n\nLast thing: if you appreciate what we’re doing and you haven’t yet subscribed, please consider it.

Last week, he quit, <a href=\"https://mrwinstonmarshall.medium.com/why-im-leaving-mumford-sons-e6e731bbc255\">writing</a> in part: &#8220;I could remain and continue to self-censor but it will erode my sense of integrity. Gnaw my conscience. I&#8217;ve already felt that beginning.&#8221;</p><p>In this episode, Bari speaks to Winston about why he chose to walk away from the band he loved.</p><p>Below is an edited and condensed version of the conversation we had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-winston-marshall-left-mumford-sons/id1570872415?i=1000527565982\">on the podcast</a>.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>BW: </strong>Winston Marshall, welcome to Honestly.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Thank you, Bari. A great pleasure.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>One of the reasons I'm really excited to talk to you is that I think what you've just experienced represents a kind of modern archetype. It goes like this: a person stumbles over a tripwire on the Internet. Then everything explodes around them. And it doesn't just harm the person that stumbled over the tripwire -- you, in this case -- it comes to affect everyone around them.&nbsp;</p><p>The person then faces a choice: How do you make this explosion go away? The way that most people move through that moment is by apologizing and then remaining quiet indefinitely, hoping to never stumble over anything again.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes you different is that you decided not to capitulate. You decided not to play by the rules, the rules being to remain silent, to nod along, and give in to all of the tiny little lies that are required for you to maintain your prestige or your status, which in your case meant your band, and in my case, meant a newspaper. I'm not sure if that resonates with you, but that's the thing that really leapt out to me about your situation: that you've made a choice that's so different from the choice that so many others have made.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>It began when I tweeted about a book that documents far left behavior in the U.S. And I'd been tweeting about books through the pandemic. But this one sort of seemed to take off. And there's a couple of waves to what happens. Firstly it starts to take off and then you have a swarm of snakes who come for every aspect of your life. For example, for me, they started messing about with my Wikipedia page saying calling me a fascist and Nazi and all these ridiculous things. And then there's a sort of second wave where they come for your friends and your associates and their families. And it's and it's very intimidating. It's a very effective mode of intimidation because it's one thing when they come for you. But when they come for those you love, you want to defend them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So what inspired this attack was a tweet that just said that you had read an important book and you praised a journalist as brave. And the book is called, for those who haven&#8217;t heard of it, &#8216;Unmasked&#8217; and it's a book about the movement Antifa and the violence that Antifa is perpetuating in cities like Portland.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>I apologized soon after the tweet. The reason being that I was sincerely open to understanding what I maybe I had missed on the topic or what about my tweet was offensive and I wanted to examine that. But I saw more and more clearly, I felt that I had participated in that lie that either extremism didn't exist or was a force for good. And that began to really bother my conscience. At the beginning, my integrity for the first month or so, my integrity felt okay because I was like, &#8216;You put your friends first, you fucked up.&#8217; And then there were other people then assuming that if I was critical of the far left, then I must be pro the far right. Obviously I absolutely, unequivocally condemn the far right.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>There's this trope out there that like Antifa either doesn't exist or is genuinely a force for fighting fascism rather than its own kind of extremism.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>That wordplay stuff is incredibly effective on Twitter. In Britain, we've got &#8216;Don&#8217;t Fund Hate&#8217; which is trying to take down GB News. I&#8217;m rereading Vaclav Havel and he talks about the greengrocer putting up the sign saying &#8220;Workers of the World Unite.&#8221; Who would disagree with &#8220;Workers of the World Unite.&#8221; And you have the example of North Korea, &#8216;The People's Democratic Republic,&#8217; or whatever it's called. It&#8217;s absolutely absurd.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>The way this ideology works is like trapping people in this word game. So all of a sudden, by criticizing Antifa, in the scheme of this word game, you became the fascist.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Quite.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Had you felt in the past like you had had you stumbled onto land mines before? Or had you been tamping down your views about any number of issues for the sake of the band?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Well, this is where I thought that your resignation letter. One thing that resonated with me is the idea that Twitter had become the editor of The New York Times, and I'm aware that similar in music or I'm sure for all companies dealing with public relations, is that Twitter basically dictates their public relations. Because if you say the wrong thing or support the wrong thing, according to whatever Twitter mob that then dictates the press, then the press damages reputations. So there's a real similarity there, I think. And a previous example certainly for me was meeting Jordan Peterson a few years ago. For me, his work was pretty influential on my contribution to the last record. But the difficult thing is that, according to Twitter, it's a divisive issue. And the music press, on the whole, is probably quite biased. So I never really trusted them to be able to talk about something that I thought was really positive and cool and exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I'd love to hear more about the influence that his work had on your contribution to the album.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>He&#8217;s got some lectures linking Milton to mental health. And actually there's a couple of songs where we cite Milton, we have someone reading Milton over a track. I would have wanted to tell the story because I thought it might be of interest, but I can never feel with the music press who were both biased and influenced by whatever mobs that I could never say that or get into it particularly.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>When you apologized, was the goal to kill the story publicly or was the goal to apologize to the members of the band? There's a lot of ways that you can read an apology like that. And I'm curious what your goal was.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>I was absolutely, totally sincere in being sorry to the band and remain so. What I had done had been unintentional, but it brought a lot of trouble to them. And so I was and am still sorry for that. The apology wasn't for what I did, it was for how it was interpreted. So I think it was true at the time.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>It&#8217;s a strange moment that we're living in because apologies are such intimate things and forgiveness is something that's granted between people that are connected to each other. Apologies are something that are for everyone on the Internet all of a sudden. It seems so antithetical to the nature of what an apology is meant to be about.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>I'm not so critical of people apologizing, because firstly, you don't know what stress they're under, you don't know what pressure they're under. They have people that they're responsible for. It's very difficult. Those can be very difficult moments. I would never assume that those apologies are insincere.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>When I left the Times and wrote that resignation letter I was pretty angry. And I feel like one of the things that comes through in your essay so powerfully, and that makes it that much more heartbreaking, is just how much you love this band. And so it really must not have been an easy decision to walk away.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>It was the bloody hardest decision I can remember. I've been in the band since I was 19. It was a really difficult thing, but I didn't see another way out of this sort of moral conundrum that I found myself in. And so this felt like the right way forward.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>In the months that you were dealing with the moral conundrum, what were you reading and who were you talking to that were leading you or advising you?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Well, I actually was reading a great biography of Churchill by Andrew Roberts .&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Oh, it's amazing.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>I'm a big admirer of Roberts. And I was reading that's kind of just to emotionally unwind and get away,</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>A thousand page book about Churchill too emotionally unwind. I love it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>I was talking a lot to my mom and dad with whom I'm very close and I think who love me and understand me better than anyone and could understand the complexity of the situation. I was praying a hell of a lot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Over the past year I've read &#8216;Live not by Lies&#8217; dozens of times. For me I'm relating to it historically. But when I saw that you quoted him, given that I know that you are religious and that he was a devout Christian, I wondered if it resonated for you on a deeper level and if that was one of the reasons that you decided to quote that essay in yours.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>I quoted the essay because I was reading it in that period between the apology and my Medium post and that particular passage was just hitting me. I think Solzhenitsyn is relevant to this situation. He talks about the line between good and evil cutting through the center of every human heart. And that is lost in discourse today, I think a lot of people say, &#8216;oh, he's a good guy&#8217; or &#8216;fuck that guy, he&#8217;s a bad guy.&#8221; Instead of accepting what I think is a Christian value, the idea that everyone is fallen, it&#8217;s back to the binary black and white, good guys, bad guys, goodies, baddies.&nbsp;</p><p>Another bit of Solzhenitsyn in the article from the Gulag Archipelago, which is: &#8220;Purify your heart, rub your eyes and cherish above all else those who love you and wish you well.&#8221; That line made me feel like I was doing the right thing in trying to protect my bandmates, but I'm not too familiar with Solzhenitsyn and his faith.&nbsp;</p><p>My faith has played a big part in this period of my life and actually the week before making the final decision, I was pretty much planted in my local Catholic Church around the corner from the house. It's a bloody big moment for me. That's probably why after a while, the apology was bothering me like it did, particularly that I'd felt like I'd been participating in that lie that we already talked about. I couldn't square those things in my conscience.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>One of the things that I have noticed is that an inordinate number of people who have been willing to tell the truth and stand up to the new illiberalism, are religious. And I wondered if you could just tell us a little bit more about how your faith guided you through this decision or maybe to put it another way, maybe it's that your faith anchors you in values that are so much bigger and more eternal than the idiot winds that feel like they're sweeping through our politics every day.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Well, if I can quote the great American theologian of all time, Kanye West, he said, fear God and you will fear nothing else. And I love that because for me, I do fear God. And I think it's true. That if you fear God sincerely, then you won't fear worldly issues, worldly problems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW</strong> If you stayed in the band, what would you have had to sacrifice or how would you have had to maybe shrink yourself?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>A good friend of mine asked me this before, when I told him I was going to leave. It's a little bit hard to articulate. I'm sure that whatever time we're promoting the next thing that this stuff will come up and it would just be a distraction. And now that I'm removed, they don't have that anymore.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I imagine you were nervous to hit publish on this essay?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Bloody terrified. Yeah, particularly the last half an hour before I was very nervous, but I feel like it's gone. I feel like I got my integrity back and I feel like I got my soul back. I feel good now.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>You said earlier that even if no one read it, that you would feel like you had gotten your soul back. But I also imagine that you wanted this to be read. And I'd love to know what you hoped people would take away from this?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>People have taken quite a few messages from it, it's been read now, I think over six hundred and sixty thousand times, which I think is quite a lot.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Was that well beyond what you expected?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Yeah, I never imagined that at all. And look, people have taken different things from it. My primary goal was to restore my integrity and to let it be known how great those three lads are.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Had you ever worked harder on a piece of writing than you did on that essay?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>It was very, very important for me because if it was done badly, it could really screw up a lot. So I've never certainly never worked on an essay harder than that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Yeah. I can't help but think about, not just life before the Internet, but life before it feels like maybe the past five years where it would be really hard to imagine a situation like this. The idea that politics has swallowed everything and that everything needs to be put to a political litmus test like that, that's relatively new. And I'm wondering, when did you start to feel that shift as someone who's been in this band since you were 19 years old?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>It's a little bit pithy to say this, and not totally accurate, but you could say, when we were promoting stuff before 2016, they didn't ask about politics. And then after 2016, they basically didn't ask about music. That's not entirely true, obviously. But there was definitely a change in 2016 where everything became political and there's nothing political about the music we made. And that sort of charged everyone.</p><p>I remember thinking at the beginning of the pandemic: Oh, I hope that finally this will be the thing that brings everyone together, for all the trouble and all the hell that this might bring us together. And there were signs of that at the beginning, like we had these cheers for the NHS once a week in England. And it felt like unity. The only other time we really get it is when there's an England football tournament on, which we have at the moment. And it's going quite well! But I think that the pandemic just exacerbated all the divisions we already had.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Exactly.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>It just spun out.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Well, the message was: we're all in this together. But no, we're not, because we're just all living online, getting deeper and deeper into our new political tribes. And in lieu of actually meeting people face to face -- it's really hard to say horrible things to someone in the flesh -- it's super easy to do it when you're writing from behind an avatar, you know?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. And Bari, I don't know how it ends.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>How do you think it ends?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Oh, I hope it ends. I have no idea how. Do you have an idea?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I don't have an answer and I don't think anyone does</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Aliens?</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Aliens could definitely help. Let's get swallowed up by a common enemy or like, you know, they come in peace hoping to transform our civilization, I don't know. Listen, I don't think anyone has a smart or satisfying answer. Lots of people have lots of different ideas about how we can resist the tsunami of change that's being caused by the Internet, like it's remaking our brains, it's remaking our society, it's remaking what it means to be human. So I don't have an answer for the algorithm problem. What I do know is that, in our individual lives, rooting down into the things that matter -- for me, that is my Judaism, it's my family, it's my relationship, it's living a life that my future children would be proud of and also like absolutely refusing to participate in mobs. If enough people did that, it actually seems to me like it would make a difference.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Absolutely. Yeah, recognizing that our fellow man. We're all fallen and recognizing that we make mistakes and bring back a bit of grace and good faith.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I think a lot of people would see you leave the band and assume: he would never walk away from something so good unless he had some secret plan in his back pocket. In my case, that just wasn't true at all. Any idea about what's going to come next for you?</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Well, I'm certainly going to carry on with my Hong Kong integration work. I co-founded a nonprofit organization in January with an asylum seeker from Hong Kong in London. And we connect Brits with Hong Kong citizens. It's called Hong Kong Link Up. It&#8217;s been very fulfilling and I&#8217;m going to definitely carry on with that in the meantime. And I hope to carry on making music. And the response to the Medium article has been so positive that I feel quite encouraged to continue my writing.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I know of this girl with a newsletter that might be really interested in publishing you.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>Oh, you&#8217;ve got a newsletter? Well, let's talk.</p><p><strong>BW:</strong> I want to thank you so much for taking the time. When I read your essay, I thought: this is the kind of thing that makes a difference. This is the kind of thing that makes a dent in pushing our merciless culture towards something more human and humane and gracious. Thank you for talking to me and thank you for standing up for the truth. I'm really excited to see what you do next, and hopefully we can find a way to do something together.</p><p><strong>WM: </strong>That means a tremendous amount for me, so thank you. And thank you for your wonderful questions. </p>","content:encodedSnippet":"a.image2.image-link.image2-972-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.75824175824175%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.75824175824175%, 972px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-972-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 972px;\n          }\n        Winston Marshall performs in 2018 in California.

So I think it was true at the time.\nBW: It’s a strange moment that we're living in because apologies are such intimate things and forgiveness is something that's granted between people that are connected to each other. Apologies are something that are for everyone on the Internet all of a sudden. It seems so antithetical to the nature of what an apology is meant to be about.\nWM: I'm not so critical of people apologizing, because firstly, you don't know what stress they're under, you don't know what pressure they're under. They have people that they're responsible for. It's very difficult. Those can be very difficult moments. I would never assume that those apologies are insincere.\nBW: When I left the Times and wrote that resignation letter I was pretty angry. And I feel like one of the things that comes through in your essay so powerfully, and that makes it that much more heartbreaking, is just how much you love this band. And so it really must not have been an easy decision to walk away.\nWM: It was the bloody hardest decision I can remember. I've been in the band since I was 19. It was a really difficult thing, but I didn't see another way out of this sort of moral conundrum that I found myself in. And so this felt like the right way forward. \nBW: In the months that you were dealing with the moral conundrum, what were you reading and who were you talking to that were leading you or advising you?\nWM: Well, I actually was reading a great biography of Churchill by Andrew Roberts . \nBW: Oh, it's amazing.\nWM: I'm a big admirer of Roberts. And I was reading that's kind of just to emotionally unwind and get away,\nBW: A thousand page book about Churchill too emotionally unwind. I love it. \nWM: I was talking a lot to my mom and dad with whom I'm very close and I think who love me and understand me better than anyone and could understand the complexity of the situation. I was praying a hell of a lot. \nBW: Over the past year I've read ‘Live not by Lies’ dozens of times. For me I'm relating to it historically. But when I saw that you quoted him, given that I know that you are religious and that he was a devout Christian, I wondered if it resonated for you on a deeper level and if that was one of the reasons that you decided to quote that essay in yours.\nWM: I quoted the essay because I was reading it in that period between the apology and my Medium post and that particular passage was just hitting me. I think Solzhenitsyn is relevant to this situation. He talks about the line between good and evil cutting through the center of every human heart. And that is lost in discourse today, I think a lot of people say, ‘oh, he's a good guy’ or ‘fuck that guy, he’s a bad guy.” Instead of accepting what I think is a Christian value, the idea that everyone is fallen, it’s back to the binary black and white, good guys, bad guys, goodies, baddies. \nAnother bit of Solzhenitsyn in the article from the Gulag Archipelago, which is: “Purify your heart, rub your eyes and cherish above all else those who love you and wish you well.” That line made me feel like I was doing the right thing in trying to protect my bandmates, but I'm not too familiar with Solzhenitsyn and his faith. \nMy faith has played a big part in this period of my life and actually the week before making the final decision, I was pretty much planted in my local Catholic Church around the corner from the house. It's a bloody big moment for me. That's probably why after a while, the apology was bothering me like it did, particularly that I'd felt like I'd been participating in that lie that we already talked about. I couldn't square those things in my conscience.\nBW: One of the things that I have noticed is that an inordinate number of people who have been willing to tell the truth and stand up to the new illiberalism, are religious. And I wondered if you could just tell us a little bit more about how your faith guided you through this decision or maybe to put it another way, maybe it's that your faith anchors you in values that are so much bigger and more eternal than the idiot winds that feel like they're sweeping through our politics every day.\nWM: Well, if I can quote the great American theologian of all time, Kanye West, he said, fear God and you will fear nothing else. And I love that because for me, I do fear God. And I think it's true. That if you fear God sincerely, then you won't fear worldly issues, worldly problems. \nBW If you stayed in the band, what would you have had to sacrifice or how would you have had to maybe shrink yourself? \nWM: A good friend of mine asked me this before, when I told him I was going to leave. It's a little bit hard to articulate. I'm sure that whatever time we're promoting the next thing that this stuff will come up and it would just be a distraction. And now that I'm removed, they don't have that anymore.\nBW: I imagine you were nervous to hit publish on this essay?\nWM: Bloody terrified. Yeah, particularly the last half an hour before I was very nervous, but I feel like it's gone. I feel like I got my integrity back and I feel like I got my soul back. I feel good now.\nBW: You said earlier that even if no one read it, that you would feel like you had gotten your soul back. But I also imagine that you wanted this to be read. And I'd love to know what you hoped people would take away from this?\nWM: People have taken quite a few messages from it, it's been read now, I think over six hundred and sixty thousand times, which I think is quite a lot.\nBW: Was that well beyond what you expected?\nWM: Yeah, I never imagined that at all. And look, people have taken different things from it. My primary goal was to restore my integrity and to let it be known how great those three lads are. \nBW: Had you ever worked harder on a piece of writing than you did on that essay?\nWM: It was very, very important for me because if it was done badly, it could really screw up a lot. So I've never certainly never worked on an essay harder than that. \nBW: Yeah. I can't help but think about, not just life before the Internet, but life before it feels like maybe the past five years where it would be really hard to imagine a situation like this. The idea that politics has swallowed everything and that everything needs to be put to a political litmus test like that, that's relatively new. And I'm wondering, when did you start to feel that shift as someone who's been in this band since you were 19 years old?\nWM: It's a little bit pithy to say this, and not totally accurate, but you could say, when we were promoting stuff before 2016, they didn't ask about politics. And then after 2016, they basically didn't ask about music. That's not entirely true, obviously. But there was definitely a change in 2016 where everything became political and there's nothing political about the music we made. And that sort of charged everyone.\nI remember thinking at the beginning of the pandemic: Oh, I hope that finally this will be the thing that brings everyone together, for all the trouble and all the hell that this might bring us together. And there were signs of that at the beginning, like we had these cheers for the NHS once a week in England. And it felt like unity. The only other time we really get it is when there's an England football tournament on, which we have at the moment. And it's going quite well! But I think that the pandemic just exacerbated all the divisions we already had.\nBW: Exactly.\nWM: It just spun out.\nBW: Well, the message was: we're all in this together. But no, we're not, because we're just all living online, getting deeper and deeper into our new political tribes. And in lieu of actually meeting people face to face -- it's really hard to say horrible things to someone in the flesh -- it's super easy to do it when you're writing from behind an avatar, you know? \nWM: Yeah, absolutely. And Bari, I don't know how it ends.\nBW: How do you think it ends?\nWM: Oh, I hope it ends. I have no idea how. Do you have an idea? \nBW: I don't have an answer and I don't think anyone does\nWM: Aliens?\nBW: Aliens could definitely help. Let's get swallowed up by a common enemy or like, you know, they come in peace hoping to transform our civilization, I don't know. Listen, I don't think anyone has a smart or satisfying answer. Lots of people have lots of different ideas about how we can resist the tsunami of change that's being caused by the Internet, like it's remaking our brains, it's remaking our society, it's remaking what it means to be human. So I don't have an answer for the algorithm problem. What I do know is that, in our individual lives, rooting down into the things that matter -- for me, that is my Judaism, it's my family, it's my relationship, it's living a life that my future children would be proud of and also like absolutely refusing to participate in mobs. If enough people did that, it actually seems to me like it would make a difference.\nWM: Absolutely. Yeah, recognizing that our fellow man. We're all fallen and recognizing that we make mistakes and bring back a bit of grace and good faith.\nBW: I think a lot of people would see you leave the band and assume: he would never walk away from something so good unless he had some secret plan in his back pocket. In my case, that just wasn't true at all. Any idea about what's going to come next for you?\nWM: Well, I'm certainly going to carry on with my Hong Kong integration work. I co-founded a nonprofit organization in January with an asylum seeker from Hong Kong in London. And we connect Brits with Hong Kong citizens. It's called Hong Kong Link Up. It’s been very fulfilling and I’m going to definitely carry on with that in the meantime. And I hope to carry on making music. And the response to the Medium article has been so positive that I feel quite encouraged to continue my writing.\nBW: I know of this girl with a newsletter that might be really interested in publishing you.\nWM: Oh, you’ve got a newsletter? Well, let's talk.\nBW: I want to thank you so much for taking the time. When I read your essay, I thought: this is the kind of thing that makes a difference. This is the kind of thing that makes a dent in pushing our merciless culture towards something more human and humane and gracious. Thank you for talking to me and thank you for standing up for the truth. I'm really excited to see what you do next, and hopefully we can find a way to do something together.\nWM: That means a tremendous amount for me, so thank you. And thank you for your wonderful questions.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e21c03d-9dab-4906-bbfd-822f2c983c18_3000x2003.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Bari Weiss","content":"Talking to the musician about why he walked away from Mumford & Sons.","contentSnippet":"Talking to the musician about why he walked away from Mumford & Sons.","guid":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/my-conversation-with-winston-marshall","isoDate":"2021-07-02T01:15:54.000Z","itunes":{}},{"creator":"Arnold Roth","title":"Will Joe Biden Grant My Daughter Justice?","link":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/will-joe-biden-grant-my-daughter","pubDate":"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 15:32:03 GMT","content:encoded":"<p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-387-513\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c5e84f5-2cc9-40c1-8759-2886b0e8b00b_513x387.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c5e84f5-2cc9-40c1-8759-2886b0e8b00b_513x387.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c5e84f5-2cc9-40c1-8759-2886b0e8b00b_513x387.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:387,&quot;width&quot;:513,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:288109,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-387-513 {\n            padding-bottom: 75.43859649122807%;\n            padding-bottom: min(75.43859649122807%, 387px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-387-513 img {\n            max-width: 513px;\n            max-height: 387px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Malki Roth making music on the bus during a school trip.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>There are 14 million Jews in the world.

All went unacknowledged.&nbsp;</p><p>The captured Israeli soldier, Shalit, returned to the embrace of his family.

I would venture a guess that a majority of them know the name Gilad Shalit.\nIn 2006, the Israeli soldier, then 19 years old, was kidnapped by Hamas in a cross border raid. Two other soldiers were killed in the ambush. Shalit, wounded, was dragged into the Gaza Strip through one of the terrorist group’s myriad underground tunnels.\nFor five years, he remained there.\nPerhaps in a bigger, less connected country he would have been forgotten. (How many Americans know the plight of Robert Levinson or Austin Tice?) But America isn’t Israel.\nOver the course of two weeks, Shalit’s parents walked from their home in northern Israel to Jerusalem. There, they set up a tent outside the prime minister’s home and didn’t move. Israeli pop stars wrote songs about the soldier. Billboards insisting Shalit was alive went up around the country. And Jews around the world rallied to the cause of his freedom. He was, as Rabbi Daniel Gordis wrote recently in a moving essay, “ha-yeled shel kulanu” — the son of all of us.\nThat familial feeling, as I wrote in a Times column last year, “is really the only way to understand why, in October 2011, Israel released 1,027 prisoners, some of them hardened terrorists, more than 300 of whom were serving life sentences, in exchange for this one ordinary soldier.” \nTo an outsider, “the exchange defied rationality. But only 14 percent of Israelis opposed it. Among them were parents just like the Shalits — only their sons and daughters had been murdered in terrorist attacks ordered by the people Israel was now freeing.”\nAt the time I wrote those words I didn’t have specific sons and daughters and anguished parents in mind. Now I do. One of them is today’s author.\nIn 2001, Arnold and Frimet Roth lost their daughter, Malki. She was 15 years old when a suicide bomb went off at Sbarro’s Pizzeria in Jerusalem. Malki was murdered alongside her lifelong friend, Michal Raziel.\nFor reasons you will learn below, the Roths have spent the past decade of their lives desperately trying to regain the measure of justice they briefly had for their daughter. Now they are appealing directly to President Joe Biden.\nIf Gilad Shalit is Israel’s son, Malki Roth is equally Israel’s daughter. May her memory continue to be a blessing and may her parents find the justice they seek.\n— BW\n\n\nA deafening explosion on a blazing summer afternoon 20 years ago ripped apart a Jerusalem pizzeria filled with families. Among the 15 killed in the Sbarro massacre on August 9, 2001, were my daughter Malki, 15, and her closest friend Michal, 16. Half the dead and most of the 130 wounded were children. \nThe terrorist sought a child-rich target and found it.\nAhlam Tamimi, a young Jordanian woman and an aspiring journalist, delivered the human bomb: a Palestinian man with a Hamas-made explosives-and-shrapnel-filled guitar case slung over his shoulder.\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-950-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 65.24725274725274%;\n            padding-bottom: min(65.24725274725274%, 950px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-950-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 950px;\n          }\n        Israeli soldiers check for explosives after the suicide bombing. August 9, 2001. (Courtney Kealy/Getty Images)\nTamimi made her get-away before the bomb detonated. She had no intention of dying that day and was well on her way out of the center of Jerusalem as it filled with dazed and hysterical survivors, first responders, security forces and Haredi volunteers engaged in gathering up body parts, some of them peeled off walls or pavement, for later burial. Their gruesome presence became a familiar sight in the following years as crowded Israeli buses and cafés became the targets of choice for Hamas, Fatah and similar agents of unfathomable darkness. \nTamimi was a 21-year-old journalism student freshly arrived from Jordan who worked evenings as a news reader for an Arab station located in Ramallah, only an hour’s drive from the site of the carnage. A video clip of her presenting that night’s news bulletin on Al-Istiqlal TV may be the only instance in the annals of television where an atrocity was reported by the perpetrator. Later, Tamimi spoke of how hard it was to suppress the jubilation that the deaths and injuries of Jews — especially Jewish children — aroused within her.\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-400-640 {\n            padding-bottom: 62.5%;\n            padding-bottom: min(62.5%, 400px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-400-640 img {\n            max-width: 640px;\n            max-height: 400px;\n          }\n        Tamimi reads the news of the bombing she had orchestrated. August 9, 2001 (Screenshot)\nIsraeli authorities arrested Tamimi a few weeks later. But this account is not one of those conventional narratives of justice triumphing over evil. I wish it were.\nOurs is a story of parents whose shiva for a much-loved child has gone on for two decades. Abandoned by the government of Israel, our chosen home, we are now pleading with the one power in a position to see justice done: the United States. \n\n\nIn 2003, an Israeli court sentenced Tamimi to 16 consecutive terms of life imprisonment. She confessed to all charges, smiling throughout the proceedings. Horrified by the brazenness of a defendant manifesting “the very lowest level of humankind,” as the court put it, the judges recommended she never be eligible for early parole or a pardon.\nKnowing she would spend the rest of her life in prison left the pain of our loss undiminished, but it brought a certain degree of closure. What followed after felt like being in a slow-motion car crash.\nIn October 2011, under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu — a prime minister who made his international reputation by authoring a bestseller arguing that deals must never be done with terrorists — Tamimi was one of 1,027 convicted terrorists, released by Israel in exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who had been held hostage by Hamas for five years. \nIt was an extortionate deal, rammed through by senior politicians with only some lip-service paid to the anguish it would inflict upon the victims and their families. While it was happening, my wife and I quietly delivered several letters to the office of Prime Minister Netanyahu — handed personally to him, we were told — explaining why Tamimi should not be part of the transaction. All went unacknowledged. \nThe captured Israeli soldier, Shalit, returned to the embrace of his family. In the meantime, our daughter’s murderer embarked on years of victory laps and stardom across the Middle East. Public appearances, speeches and raucous celebrations elevated her to pan-Arab celebrity. She even got her own TV show.\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.68956043956044%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.68956043956044%, 971px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 971px;\n          }\n        Tamimi waves as she arrives at Queen Alia international airport in Amman on October 18, 2011. (Louai Beshara/AFP via Getty Images)\nWe had an initial taste of the nightmare ahead in one of her first interviews following her return to Amman: “I do not regret what happened” she said on camera. “Absolutely not. This is the path. I dedicated myself to Jihad for the sake of Allah, and Allah granted me success. You know how many casualties there were. This was made possible by Allah. Do you want me to denounce what I did? That's out of the question. I would do it again today and in the same manner.” It felt as if Malki was being buried again. \nThen, in the midst of our despair, we found hope. It came via two pieces of information. \nFirst, we learned that because Americans had been murdered at Sbarro, a rarely-invoked federal law, Section 2332a of Title 18 of the United States code, might apply to get Tamimi back behind bars in the U.S.\nSecond, we learned that Jordan and the United States have had an extradition treaty since 1995.\nThe lives of three U.S. nationals and one unborn American child ended in the Sbarro conflagration. One was a newly married young woman, herself an only child, visiting from New Jersey. She was pregnant with her first baby. Next, a young mother was catastrophically brain-damaged, alive but in a vegetative coma to this day. (The toddler daughter she was eating pizza with survived unharmed and grew up motherless.) And finally, our Malki, an American citizen because her mother is a native New Yorker. \nSo we took our case to Washington. \n\n\nWe imagined an open-and-shut case. It hasn’t worked out that way.\nWhat followed were five aching years of Sisyphean frustration, campaigning for justice under Section 2332a, creating jurisdiction in U.S. federal court for criminal offenses causing the death of American nationals outside the country by means of a weapon of mass destruction.\nIn 2013, the DOJ filed charges against Tamimi in federal court. But then it promptly sealed them, revealing their existence only four years later. In March 2017, apparently after behind-the-scenes diplomacy with Jordan failed, senior Justice Department officials unsealed the charges, branding Tamimi “an unrepentant terrorist” and adding her to the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist list. A $5 million bounty was announced in early 2018.\nThe other fugitives on this list are, not surprisingly, all in hiding. But the investigators and prosecutors at the DOJ and the FBI know exactly where Tamimi lives. Since 2011, she has lived spectacularly free in Jordan’s capital, Amman, where she is a folk hero.  In a recent tribute to her on “Caravan,” one of Jordan’s most watched TV shows, the excited presenter blurted out to Tamimi and her convicted-terrorist husband, Nazir Tamimi: “You, the people of the struggle, elevate the name of Jordan!” \nWhy has my daughter’s murderer been allowed to thrive? \nCynics point to the realpolitik of our situation. Jordan is a key U.S. ally; justice for a murdered American girl is simply not worth disrupting such an important alliance. This theory is bolstered by the U.S.’s near-apathetic response to the grisly murder of Washington Post columnist and Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.\nBut Jordan offered another explanation. In March 2017, six days after the criminal charges against Tamimi were unsealed and more than two decades after the extradition treaty with the U.S. went into effect, Jordan’s highest court declared the 1995 treaty to be invalid. Jordan’s most senior judges said it had never been ratified by the Jordanian legislature.\nThat isn’t true. Jordan had indeed ratified the treaty. I know because my wife and I used our right under the Freedom of Information Act to request the 1995 treaty documents from the State Department. When they failed to hand them over, we sued. In April, the State Department released the key documents.\nThey contained a bombshell. \nWriting in regal style and invoking the “guidance of God,” the late King Hussein declared in a July 13, 1995, document addressed to the U.S. government his personal agreement as Jordan’s sovereign “to and ratification of that treaty in whole and in part. We further pledge to carry out its provisions and abide by its Articles, and we, God willing, shall not allow its violation.”\nJordan betrayed the treaty, plain as day. But no U.S. government official has publicly addressed Jordan’s failure to comply with its treaty obligation, let alone protest the moral offense or the insult to American interests and decades of mutually beneficial relations. \nTamimi’s name is vastly better known than that of my child and the other victims. In large part this is because there has not been a single investigative report in any part of the mainstream U.S. media into how the world’s most wanted female fugitive remains free. All of this means you likely know nothing about my daughter Malki and the luminous goodness of her tragically short life. That has been the most humiliating dimension of our battle.\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-807-800 {\n            padding-bottom: 100.875%;\n            padding-bottom: min(100.875%, 807px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-807-800 img {\n            max-width: 800px;\n            max-height: 807px;\n          }\n        Malki embracing Michal. The girls are buried beside each other.\nAs a parent seeking justice, I know I need to stay calm and restrained. But I have been suppressing an internal volcano for many years now. Together with my wife, I have implored officials at every level in Jerusalem, Washington and Amman to honor justice, the law, and bilateral treaty relationships by allowing a prosecution of obvious justice to proceed. \nWe have blogged and written Op-Eds. We have spoken by video conference and addressed live audiences. We have asked for support — and we have been stunned by how almost none of the details were known by our audiences until we conveyed them. \nPresident Joe Biden, who knows well the inexpressible pain of losing a child, has a unique opportunity to deliver us justice. Later this month, Jordan’s King Abdullah II will be paying an official visit to Washington, the first Arab leader to meet personally with the 46th president. \nPresident Biden, we beg you: press him to live up to Jordan’s promise by extraditing Ahlam Tamimi. Let her stand trial for murdering innocent Americans — one of them, my child.\n\n\nThere was one photograph Arnold shared with me that moved me more than any other. It is a picture of Malki’s phone and its case, both recovered by police in the wreckage:\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-1160-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 79.67032967032966%;\n            padding-bottom: min(79.67032967032966%, 1160px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-1160-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 1160px;\n          }\n        \nArnold wrote me that the nails, which fell out of the case when he opened it, “seemed such a tangible materialization of the forces of evil that had forced their way into our unsuspecting lives. They are such a striking contrast to what Malki had written on her phone.”  The teenager had drawn ladybugs. And she had written a phrase in Hebrew at the bottom: “assur ledaber lashon harah,” the simplest expression of the Jewish prohibition against speaking ill of others. \nIn addition to her parents, Malki was survived by six siblings. One of them, Haya, has severe disabilities and Malki was deeply devoted to her care. The Malki Foundation was established to support Israeli families with children like Haya. You can learn more about their fine work here.\nIf you are interested in learning more about this story, David Horovitz, editor of The Times of Israel, has written the definitive piece on the case. I highly recommend it.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c5e84f5-2cc9-40c1-8759-2886b0e8b00b_513x387.png","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Arnold Roth","content":"Israel's government betrayed my child.

It’s called “Bad News: How Woke Media Is Undermining Democracy.” For obvious reasons, I can’t wait to read it. \n\n\nLast thing:\nApple Daily may be closed, but the repression of its journalists is a developing story. Hours after I published yesterday’s column and podcast came the news that a senior journalist for the paper, Fung Wai-kwong, was arrested at Hong Kong International Airport as he was trying to fly out of the city. In a statement, the police accused him of “conspiring to collude with foreign countries or foreign forces to endanger national security.”\nI am thinking of him, of the young reporter I spoke to, and all of their courageous colleagues.\n\nSubscribe now","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F663b2e6d-5bed-44f1-a1e2-b7efefb26b3b_5867x3911.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Bari Weiss","content":"The new inclusion policy put out by Amazon Studios offers entries on \"womxn\" and \"acquired limb difference.\" Meantime, the company's drivers urinate in bottles.","contentSnippet":"The new inclusion policy put out by Amazon Studios offers entries on \"womxn\" and \"acquired limb difference.\" Meantime, the company's drivers urinate in bottles.","guid":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/amazons-woke-smokescreen","isoDate":"2021-06-28T12:05:07.000Z","itunes":{}},{"creator":"Bari Weiss","title":"When a Free Society Becomes a Police State","link":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/when-a-free-society-becomes-a-police","pubDate":"Sun, 27 Jun 2021 12:00:50 GMT","content:encoded":"<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-972-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd839c4a7-427c-466c-84d3-dcdf33c69959_6016x4016.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd839c4a7-427c-466c-84d3-dcdf33c69959_6016x4016.jpeg\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d839c4a7-427c-466c-84d3-dcdf33c69959_6016x4016.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:972,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:16805383,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-972-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.75824175824175%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.75824175824175%, 972px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-972-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 972px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">People in London protesting for press freedom in Hong Kong on June 19, 2021.

It wasn&#8217;t Bitcoin dropping below $30,000. And it certainly wasn&#8217;t the new bipartisan infrastructure deal announced by President Biden.</p><p>It was the forced closure of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong.</p><p>You may not have heard of Apple Daily. I knew of it, but only vaguely. It is &#8212; or rather, it was &#8212; Hong Kong&#8217;s version of the New York Post combined with William Lloyd Garrison&#8217;s The Liberator. A tabloid, yes. But also: a voice for freedom.&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since it began publishing in 1995, Apple Daily has been a thorn in the side of the Chinese Communist Party. Its commitment to democracy and freedom had everything to do with its founder, <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/research/jimmy-lai-and-fight-freedom-hong-kong-1\">Jimmy Lai</a>.</p><p>It&#8217;s not possible to do <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/business/media/for-jimmy-lai-hong-kongs-rebellious-tycoon-next-battle-may-be-in-court.html\">Lai&#8217;s whole story</a> justice in a column &#8212; someone should make a blockbuster &#8212; but here is the cliffsnotes version: Lai fled mainland China at 12 years old as a stowaway on a fishing boat. He found a job in a Hong Kong sweatshop and eventually worked his way up in the garment trade (or, as we in the Jewish community call it, the shmata business.)</p><p>Along the way, he encountered fellow garment workers in New York who introduced him to free-market theorists like Frederick Hayek, Karl Popper and Milton Friedman, with whom he later developed a close relationship. &#8220;This is a guy who didn't have any formal schooling past the age of maybe eight,&#8221; Mark Simon, who has been Lai&#8217;s right hand for the past two decades, told me in an interview this week. &#8220;Those books started his real political awakening.&#8221;</p><p>By the &#8217;80s, Lai had built out his retail empire in Hong Kong; his company, called Giordano after a New York pizza spot, became a wild success.&nbsp;</p><p>But becoming rich wasn&#8217;t what changed the course of Lai&#8217;s life. The massacre at Tiananmen Square did.</p><p>&#8220;That's when he went from his economic and intellectual awakening to his political awakening,&#8221; said Simon. &#8220;I don't want to be too crude, but [Lai] said, &#8216;I hated the bastards. I knew evil when I saw it. And they are evil.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Lai, a devout Catholic, shifted his focus from t-shirts to tabloids and began to build his media empire. The first edition of Apple Daily made its purpose plain: &#8220;We are convinced that Hongkongers who are accustomed to freedom will not stay silent in the face of unreasonable restrictions and unfair treatments, for Hongkongers are born with a passion for freedom.&#8221;</p><p>Lai and the paper lived out that mission.</p><p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-971-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a05f28e-4994-4723-9ec1-c19bce795466_2131x1421.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4a05f28e-4994-4723-9ec1-c19bce795466_2131x1421.jpeg\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4a05f28e-4994-4723-9ec1-c19bce795466_2131x1421.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:558435,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.68956043956044%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.68956043956044%, 971px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 971px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Prison guards escort Jimmy Lai to a prison van at the Lai Chi Kok Reception Center on December 12, 2020, in Hong Kong.

He was even the target of an <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/689287/man-who-put-us1m-jimmy-lai-hit\">assassination attempt</a>. But he refused to shut up.</p><p>In 2014, the tycoon took to the streets in solidarity with the students who were leading what became known as the Umbrella Movement. In 2019, when Hong Kongers took to the streets once again, this time millions of them marching against the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill.html\">new extradition bill</a>, Apple Daily printed pro-democracy posters for them to carry.&nbsp;</p><p>When the national security law passed last year, which effectively criminalized criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, Lai knew that it would not end well for him and for Apple Daily. He had more than the means to leave the city. But he refused.</p><p>Mark Simon remembers it this way: &#8220;Jimmy would tell people all the time, &#8216;Get out, get out now, <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev\">it&#8217;s 1949</a>.&#8217; Then Jimmy would be told, &#8216;Why don't you get out? Why don't you get out?&#8217; And he had an answer that I think would surprise some. He would say: &#8216;I don't want to be an asshole.&#8217; He would say, &#8216;I've been part of this fight since 1997.&#8217; He said, &#8216;If I leave now and I leave all these young people here, what kind of guy am I now?&#8217;&#8221; Last May, Lai gave an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security-jimmylai-factbox/factbox-who-is-jimmy-lai-the-media-tycoon-arrested-in-hong-kong-idUSKCN2560AE\">interview</a> to Reuters, saying: &#8220;What I have, this place gave me.

See <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phila_siu/status/1407747394670710787\">here</a>. And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrittClennett/status/1407705784482373635\">here</a>.

Throngs of readers stood outside the building shouting their support.</p><p>Thursday night I spoke to a young journalist who saw it all unfold. She didn&#8217;t want me to use her name for fear of government reprisal.&nbsp;</p><p>She&#8217;s been at Apple Daily for several years and told me that she&#8217;d always wanted to be a reporter. &#8220;I'm not sure how it is in other places apart from Hong Kong, but being a reporter has a very low salary. We become reporters because we want to speak the truth and we want to uphold justice and freedom and democracy,&#8221; she said. </p><p>She told me that Apple Daily was the only place she wanted to work: &#8220;It is the only newspaper in Hong Kong that can speak the voice of Hong Kong people. Most printed media, they will just speak or write what the government wants them to write. We are the only print media that will interview the protesters to let their real opinions show up in Hong Kong. So I think this is very precious.&#8221;</p><p>The past year has been extremely stressful, she said. &#8220;Last year when 200 policemen went into our company and later our boss got arrested, I gave my resignation letter to my boss because I felt like I couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore.&#8221; But she rescinded the letter, deciding that if she bowed out there would be one fewer reporter left in Hong Kong.</p><p>&#8220;We had our last meal in the canteen last night,&#8221; she recalled. Her boss &#8220;said that he feels very, very proud that Apple Daily ends in this way because a lot of Hong Kong people support us. I think a lot of other print media, if they have a death like this, no one will cry for it. But they will cry for Apple Daily,&#8221; she said through tears. &#8220;I really respect my colleagues. They just want to keep going. Even if they have to be sent into jail. They will still hold their pencil very tightly. And even when they imagine that maybe tomorrow I'll be sent to jail, what they are thinking is: they want to finish what they haven&#8217;t finished.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>She added: &#8220;I hope people, not only in Hong Kong, can understand what happened at Apple Daily and also treasure what they have in their own home country as well.&#8221;</p><p></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-969-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98a9b3b1-b8dd-48d2-9d30-1d2291ab4e66_5701x3793.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98a9b3b1-b8dd-48d2-9d30-1d2291ab4e66_5701x3793.jpeg\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98a9b3b1-b8dd-48d2-9d30-1d2291ab4e66_5701x3793.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2990204,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.5521978021978%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.5521978021978%, 969px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 969px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Supporters stand outside the main gate of the Apple Daily offices after the final printing.

We hear horrific stories out of China all the time. About how the CCP is carrying out a genocide against Uyghur Muslims and how it is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/22/technology/xinjiang-uyghurs-china-propaganda.html\">staging videos</a> of people pretending to be happy Uyghurs in an attempt to conceal the truth. About how it indoctrinates its people with <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-06-24/china-world-history-erasure-youth-censorship\">censorship and propaganda</a>.

About how it uses cutting edge technology to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/11/03/china-surveillance-system-backlash-worlds-largest/\">spy on its own</a>.</p><p>Why should a newspaper closure rank among such atrocities? </p><p>I asked that question to Mark Simon: &#8220;The Chinese Communist Party has become an expansionist party. They are interested not only in China now, but in the things around China,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And the killing of Apple Daily is really the largest blow against Hong Kong as a Western civil society.&#8221; Jimmy Lai put it this way in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR86rqTcn-4\">a 2019 interview</a>: &#8220;What we are fighting for is the first battle of the new cold war.&#8221;</p><p>In other words: What happens in Beijing doesn&#8217;t stay in Beijing.&nbsp;</p><p>Here I&#8217;m not just thinking of movie stars like John Cena groveling about calling Taiwan a country; or of NBA stars like Lebron James who claim the mantle of social justice but go mute in the face of the world&#8217;s greatest threat to human freedom; or of powerful brands like Apple and Nike that market themselves as progressive but rely on forced labor.

It wasn’t Bitcoin dropping below $30,000. And it certainly wasn’t the new bipartisan infrastructure deal announced by President Biden.\nIt was the forced closure of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong.\nYou may not have heard of Apple Daily. I knew of it, but only vaguely. It is — or rather, it was — Hong Kong’s version of the New York Post combined with William Lloyd Garrison’s The Liberator. A tabloid, yes. But also: a voice for freedom. \nEver since it began publishing in 1995, Apple Daily has been a thorn in the side of the Chinese Communist Party. Its commitment to democracy and freedom had everything to do with its founder, Jimmy Lai.\nIt’s not possible to do Lai’s whole story justice in a column — someone should make a blockbuster — but here is the cliffsnotes version: Lai fled mainland China at 12 years old as a stowaway on a fishing boat. He found a job in a Hong Kong sweatshop and eventually worked his way up in the garment trade (or, as we in the Jewish community call it, the shmata business.)\nAlong the way, he encountered fellow garment workers in New York who introduced him to free-market theorists like Frederick Hayek, Karl Popper and Milton Friedman, with whom he later developed a close relationship. “This is a guy who didn't have any formal schooling past the age of maybe eight,” Mark Simon, who has been Lai’s right hand for the past two decades, told me in an interview this week. “Those books started his real political awakening.”\nBy the ’80s, Lai had built out his retail empire in Hong Kong; his company, called Giordano after a New York pizza spot, became a wild success. \nBut becoming rich wasn’t what changed the course of Lai’s life. The massacre at Tiananmen Square did.\n“That's when he went from his economic and intellectual awakening to his political awakening,” said Simon. “I don't want to be too crude, but [Lai] said, ‘I hated the bastards. I knew evil when I saw it. And they are evil.’”\nLai, a devout Catholic, shifted his focus from t-shirts to tabloids and began to build his media empire. The first edition of Apple Daily made its purpose plain: “We are convinced that Hongkongers who are accustomed to freedom will not stay silent in the face of unreasonable restrictions and unfair treatments, for Hongkongers are born with a passion for freedom.”\nLai and the paper lived out that mission.\n\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.68956043956044%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.68956043956044%, 971px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 971px;\n          }\n        Prison guards escort Jimmy Lai to a prison van at the Lai Chi Kok Reception Center on December 12, 2020, in Hong Kong. (Li Zhihua/China News Service via Getty Images)\nOver the years, Lai’s home was firebombed. His office was ransacked. He was even the target of an assassination attempt. But he refused to shut up.\nIn 2014, the tycoon took to the streets in solidarity with the students who were leading what became known as the Umbrella Movement. In 2019, when Hong Kongers took to the streets once again, this time millions of them marching against the new extradition bill, Apple Daily printed pro-democracy posters for them to carry. \nWhen the national security law passed last year, which effectively criminalized criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, Lai knew that it would not end well for him and for Apple Daily. He had more than the means to leave the city. But he refused.\nMark Simon remembers it this way: “Jimmy would tell people all the time, ‘Get out, get out now, it’s 1949.’ Then Jimmy would be told, ‘Why don't you get out? Why don't you get out?’ And he had an answer that I think would surprise some. He would say: ‘I don't want to be an asshole.’ He would say, ‘I've been part of this fight since 1997.’ He said, ‘If I leave now and I leave all these young people here, what kind of guy am I now?’” Last May, Lai gave an interview to Reuters, saying: “What I have, this place gave me. I will fight on till the last day. It will be an honour if I...sacrifice.”\nToday, Jimmy Lai sits in a jail cell for “unauthorized assembly.” \nOver the past week, the same forces that jailed him came for his newspaper. Hundreds of police officers raided the newsroom. They seized hard drives and laptops. They arrested five of the company’s top executives and editors, who stand accused of collusion with foreign forces and endangering national security. They froze the company’s assets. The swashbuckling, anti-Communist tabloid, the symbol of Hong King’s free press, printed its last edition on Thursday.\nThey printed a million copies and were sold out by lunch time.\n\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.68956043956044%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.68956043956044%, 971px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 971px;\n          }\n        Supporters hold copies of the final issue in front of the Apple Daily headquarters on June 24, 2021. (Geovien So/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nThere were so many moving pictures and videos of the staff putting the paper to bed. See here. And here. And here. Throngs of readers stood outside the building shouting their support.\nThursday night I spoke to a young journalist who saw it all unfold. She didn’t want me to use her name for fear of government reprisal. \nShe’s been at Apple Daily for several years and told me that she’d always wanted to be a reporter. “I'm not sure how it is in other places apart from Hong Kong, but being a reporter has a very low salary. We become reporters because we want to speak the truth and we want to uphold justice and freedom and democracy,” she said. \nShe told me that Apple Daily was the only place she wanted to work: “It is the only newspaper in Hong Kong that can speak the voice of Hong Kong people. Most printed media, they will just speak or write what the government wants them to write. We are the only print media that will interview the protesters to let their real opinions show up in Hong Kong. So I think this is very precious.”\nThe past year has been extremely stressful, she said. “Last year when 200 policemen went into our company and later our boss got arrested, I gave my resignation letter to my boss because I felt like I couldn’t stand it anymore.” But she rescinded the letter, deciding that if she bowed out there would be one fewer reporter left in Hong Kong.\n“We had our last meal in the canteen last night,” she recalled. Her boss “said that he feels very, very proud that Apple Daily ends in this way because a lot of Hong Kong people support us. I think a lot of other print media, if they have a death like this, no one will cry for it. But they will cry for Apple Daily,” she said through tears. “I really respect my colleagues. They just want to keep going. Even if they have to be sent into jail. They will still hold their pencil very tightly. And even when they imagine that maybe tomorrow I'll be sent to jail, what they are thinking is: they want to finish what they haven’t finished.” \nShe added: “I hope people, not only in Hong Kong, can understand what happened at Apple Daily and also treasure what they have in their own home country as well.”\n\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.5521978021978%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.5521978021978%, 969px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 969px;\n          }\n        Supporters stand outside the main gate of the Apple Daily offices after the final printing. (Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty Images)\nPerhaps you read all of this and think the following: The Chinese Communist Party is terrible. We hear horrific stories out of China all the time. About how the CCP is carrying out a genocide against Uyghur Muslims and how it is staging videos of people pretending to be happy Uyghurs in an attempt to conceal the truth. About how it indoctrinates its people with censorship and propaganda. About how it disappears people. About how it uses cutting edge technology to spy on its own.\nWhy should a newspaper closure rank among such atrocities? \nI asked that question to Mark Simon: “The Chinese Communist Party has become an expansionist party. They are interested not only in China now, but in the things around China,” he said. “And the killing of Apple Daily is really the largest blow against Hong Kong as a Western civil society.” Jimmy Lai put it this way in a 2019 interview: “What we are fighting for is the first battle of the new cold war.”\nIn other words: What happens in Beijing doesn’t stay in Beijing. \nHere I’m not just thinking of movie stars like John Cena groveling about calling Taiwan a country; or of NBA stars like Lebron James who claim the mantle of social justice but go mute in the face of the world’s greatest threat to human freedom; or of powerful brands like Apple and Nike that market themselves as progressive but rely on forced labor. (This past week, as Apple Daily shuttered, the CEO of Nike said: “Nike is a brand that is of China and for China.”)\nI am also talking about the pandemic we’re still living through. It was China that lied to the world about the nature of Covid-19. It was China that disappeared scientists who tried to blow the whistle early on. In other words: we don’t need to live in mainland China to be affected by the policies and the decisions of the CCP.\nIf the CCP is willing to do that to the world, if it is willing to swallow up a city of more than 7 million people in broad daylight, crushing the free press, crushing dissent, and jailing journalists, you have to ask yourself: what — or who — will come next? \n\n\nFor the full story and deeper conversations with Mark Simon and the intrepid Apple Daily reporter, please listen here: \n\n\n\nAnd for those of you who prefer to read rather than listen — though I really hope you listen to this one — transcripts (edited for brevity and clarity) are now available for select episodes of the podcast, including today’s.\nIf you would like to receive email notifications just for these, please navigate to “My Account” and, under email notifications, check the box that says “Audio Transcriptions.”","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd839c4a7-427c-466c-84d3-dcdf33c69959_6016x4016.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Bari Weiss","content":"For 26 years, the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily was a thorn in Beijing&#8217;s side.

On Thursday June 24, after its founder was jailed, its assets frozen, its offices ransacked by hundreds of police officers, and five of its top editors and executives arrested, the paper printed its very last edition. </p><p>The next morning, I spoke to a dogged young reporter who saw it all unfold. She didn&#8217;t want me to use her name for fear of government reprisal. Below is an edited and condensed version of the conversation we had <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/10FUn8WwYhK4i8HhaT85N3?si=d0ccc5c771fd4ae8&amp;nd=1\">on the podcast</a>.</p><p><strong>Jane Doe: </strong>Hello?</p><p><strong>Bari Weiss: </strong>Can you hear me?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>Yeah, yeah, you can hear me as well?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I can hear you great.</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>That&#8217;s great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Thank you. I know it&#8217;s been a crazy week, and I so appreciate you making the time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JD</strong>: Yeah. Thank you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW</strong>: I imagine that, given that you&#8217;re a reporter, you&#8217;ve interviewed lots of people who haven&#8217;t wanted you to use their name for a variety of reasons. And today you&#8217;re in the position of you not wanting us to use yours. I wanted to start there and ask you: why?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s like a police state now in Hong Kong. Reporters, especially those who are working in Apple Daily, are now being targeted because our media company is pro-democratic and they think we are trying to do something to destroy the stability of Hong Kong. Actually, I think what we are doing is just speaking the truth and speaking to what Hong Kong people really want to say and express to the Hong Kong government.</p><p><strong>BW:</strong> Have you always wanted to be a reporter?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>Yes, I have always wanted to be a reporter because I think it&#8217;s a very meaningful job. It&#8217;s actually not a job. Like, I don&#8217;t work to earn money. I&#8217;m not sure how it goes in other places apart from Hong Kong, but reporters here have very low salaries. I think why we become reporters is because we want to speak the truth and we want to uphold justice and freedom and democracy like everyone does all around the world. As a reporter, Apple Daily is the first paper I worked for, and I think it is the only media company that I would ever work in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Why would that be the only paper that you would want to work for in Hong Kong?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>I mean, this is the only newspaper in Hong Kong that can speak the voice of Hong Kong people. Most printed media, they will just speak or write what the government wants them to. We are the only print media that will interview the protesters to let their real opinions show up in Hong Kong. So I think this is very precious. It&#8217;s what we call freedom of speech and freedom of press.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>In your reporting in 2019, and more generally covering the increasingly repressive environment in Hong Kong, did you witness people get arrested? Did you witness violence?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>Oh, yeah, sure. All the time. It&#8217;s very heartbreaking and it somehow makes me want to give up at some moments. There&#8217;s a real pressure on every reporter. It really tears us up, actually. Last year when 200 policemen went into our company and later our boss got arrested, I gave my resignation letter to my boss, because I felt like I couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore. I feel like I have some PTSD. It&#8217;s not that serious, actually, but I just feel like my whole life got torn up and I just felt so emotional every day. But then, afterwards I felt like, well, this is like my responsibility. If one reporter gives up at this time, there will be fewer reporters in Hong Kong.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So you were seriously thinking about resigning and you wrote your resignation letter, but then ultimately decided not to?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JD:</strong> Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW</strong>: What did your family think of your work as a reporter? Were they proud of the fact that you worked at Apple?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>So actually, my whole family, my parents and my little brother, they all work for the government. So when I got the chance to work in Apple Daily three years ago my whole family got so mad. My mom always puts some interview letters on my desk when I go back home because she wants me to work for the government as well. But of course, I won't listen to them. I never listen to my parents, actually, and I don&#8217;t think we need to listen to our parents. My dad is someone who really supports the government, so I already gave up on him, but my mom has actually changed a lot because of the protests in 2019. She actually sent me a message on the last day of Apple Day.&nbsp; She said, &#8216;I&#8217;m so proud of you. You have really done a great job, and I just want to hug you and cry together.&#8217; You know, that night a lot of Hong Kong people cried together just because of the death of Apple Day. </p><p><strong>BW:</strong> Yeah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JD</strong>: I think she represents a lot of normal Hong Kong people who maybe at first they disliked Apple Daily for its stances. Especially in the very old days of Apple Daily, many people in Hong Kong thought it was an unhealthy newspaper. I think under these circumstances, and after 2019, we really spoke the truth. We speak things that no one dares to speak, and it changed a lot of Hong Kong people&#8217;s perception of Apple Daily. We had our last meal in Apple Daily in the canteen last night, and my boss said that he feels very, very proud that Apple Daily ended in this way because a lot of Hong Kong people support us. I think for other print media, if they have a death like this, no one will cry for it. But they will cry for Apple Daily.&nbsp;</p><p><em>crying</em></p><p><strong>JD: </strong>I&#8217;m sorry. I just feel so sad, you know? I&#8217;m so sorry, wait for a moment.</p><p><em>crying</em></p><p><strong>JD:</strong>&nbsp; A lot of colleagues have been crying this week because we saw that our bosses and other colleagues were being sent to jail. It&#8217;s just so ridiculous. I mean, we are just reporters. And all the things we did were right.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I&#8217;m really moved by hearing that your mom, who had been critical of the paper, texted you saying that she was proud of you and understood the symbol of what this newspaper meant and what its closure means about what&#8217;s happening to Hong Kong. My understanding is that over the past two week there was another major raid in the newsroom with five executives getting arrested. Were you there that day and did you witness it?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>No. When I woke up, the first thing that I saw on my phone was the notification, saying that our colleagues were arrested. That was last Friday, right?&nbsp; It feels like a year already. So many things happen within this week. So last Friday, because the policemen were in our company they blocked all entrances and exits. We couldn&#8217;t be inside unless we were in the company at that moment. So I went back there at like 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. that day, and when I got back to my seat, I found that my seat was raided. It was totally raided. They took my hard disk.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Did they take your computer?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>What was the last story that you were working on before they took your computer and your hard drive. Do you remember?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>I was working on some education stories, and it&#8217;s very interesting because I had saved my transcript on the drive as a word document, and after they took my drive, I realized that I had to re-do the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><p>So the transcript is like 10,000 Chinese words and I had to retype all of them. And it was really stressful because on Monday we were told that the last day is today. We heard the news this past Monday. So I had to re-do the whole thing at a super crazy pace because I had to rush before the death of our newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I saw some really moving videos online of people applauding the editors. And I saw pictures of what looked like dozens, maybe hundreds of people on staff on the roof of the building. Did you participate in all of that?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>Yes. I&#8217;m one of them. We went onto the roof because we knew that there were a lot of readers and supporters who were standing outside our company and they were waving their mobile phone lights and saying something like, &#8216;Cheer up&#8217; and&nbsp; &#8216;We&#8217;ll keep fighting for Apple Daily.&#8217; They kept shouting stuff like this to encourage the people who are working in Apple Daily, and we could really hear them. It was a very touching moment. And then we turned on our lights as well, and we also shouted things like, &#8216;Hong Kongers, Keep Going&#8217; and &#8216;Never Give Up.&#8217; Things like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>The last thing I want to ask you is a big question. For people that are listening to this who maybe have never heard of Apple Daily or don&#8217;t know that much about Hong Kong, what do you want them to understand about what this newspaper means and what its closing signifies for where Hong Kong is heading?</p><p><strong>JD: </strong>Freedom of press is really so important to upholding justice and democracy in our society. If you do not have this power, who can speak the truth and who can monitor the government and the people who are in charge and have power? No one can do that if you don&#8217;t have freedom of press. I really respect my colleagues. They just want to keep going. Even if they are being sent into jail, they will still hold their pencil very tightly. And even when they imagine that, &#8216;Maybe tomorrow I'll be sent into a jail,&#8217; what they are thinking in their mind is that they want to finish what they haven't finished.

(Geovien So/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\n\nFor 26 years, the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily was a thorn in the side of the Chinese Communist Party. On Thursday June 24, after its founder was jailed, its assets frozen, its offices ransacked by hundreds of police officers, and five of its top editors and executives arrested, the paper printed its very last edition. \nThe next morning, I spoke to a dogged young reporter who saw it all unfold. She didn’t want me to use her name for fear of government reprisal. Below is an edited and condensed version of the conversation we had on the podcast.\nJane Doe: Hello?\nBari Weiss: Can you hear me?\nJD: Yeah, yeah, you can hear me as well? \nBW: I can hear you great.\nJD: That’s great.  \nBW: Thank you. I know it’s been a crazy week, and I so appreciate you making the time. \nJD: Yeah. Thank you. \nBW: I imagine that, given that you’re a reporter, you’ve interviewed lots of people who haven’t wanted you to use their name for a variety of reasons. And today you’re in the position of you not wanting us to use yours. I wanted to start there and ask you: why?\nJD:  It’s like a police state now in Hong Kong. Reporters, especially those who are working in Apple Daily, are now being targeted because our media company is pro-democratic and they think we are trying to do something to destroy the stability of Hong Kong. Actually, I think what we are doing is just speaking the truth and speaking to what Hong Kong people really want to say and express to the Hong Kong government.\nBW: Have you always wanted to be a reporter?\nJD: Yes, I have always wanted to be a reporter because I think it’s a very meaningful job. It’s actually not a job. Like, I don’t work to earn money. I’m not sure how it goes in other places apart from Hong Kong, but reporters here have very low salaries. I think why we become reporters is because we want to speak the truth and we want to uphold justice and freedom and democracy like everyone does all around the world. As a reporter, Apple Daily is the first paper I worked for, and I think it is the only media company that I would ever work in Hong Kong. \nBW: Why would that be the only paper that you would want to work for in Hong Kong?\nJD: I mean, this is the only newspaper in Hong Kong that can speak the voice of Hong Kong people. Most printed media, they will just speak or write what the government wants them to. We are the only print media that will interview the protesters to let their real opinions show up in Hong Kong. So I think this is very precious. It’s what we call freedom of speech and freedom of press. \nBW: In your reporting in 2019, and more generally covering the increasingly repressive environment in Hong Kong, did you witness people get arrested? Did you witness violence?\nJD: Oh, yeah, sure. All the time. It’s very heartbreaking and it somehow makes me want to give up at some moments. There’s a real pressure on every reporter. It really tears us up, actually. Last year when 200 policemen went into our company and later our boss got arrested, I gave my resignation letter to my boss, because I felt like I couldn’t stand it anymore. I feel like I have some PTSD. It’s not that serious, actually, but I just feel like my whole life got torn up and I just felt so emotional every day. But then, afterwards I felt like, well, this is like my responsibility. If one reporter gives up at this time, there will be fewer reporters in Hong Kong.\nBW: So you were seriously thinking about resigning and you wrote your resignation letter, but then ultimately decided not to? \nJD: Yeah. \nBW: What did your family think of your work as a reporter? Were they proud of the fact that you worked at Apple?\nJD: So actually, my whole family, my parents and my little brother, they all work for the government. So when I got the chance to work in Apple Daily three years ago my whole family got so mad. My mom always puts some interview letters on my desk when I go back home because she wants me to work for the government as well. But of course, I won't listen to them. I never listen to my parents, actually, and I don’t think we need to listen to our parents. My dad is someone who really supports the government, so I already gave up on him, but my mom has actually changed a lot because of the protests in 2019. She actually sent me a message on the last day of Apple Day.  She said, ‘I’m so proud of you. You have really done a great job, and I just want to hug you and cry together.’ You know, that night a lot of Hong Kong people cried together just because of the death of Apple Day. \nBW: Yeah. \nJD: I think she represents a lot of normal Hong Kong people who maybe at first they disliked Apple Daily for its stances. Especially in the very old days of Apple Daily, many people in Hong Kong thought it was an unhealthy newspaper. I think under these circumstances, and after 2019, we really spoke the truth. We speak things that no one dares to speak, and it changed a lot of Hong Kong people’s perception of Apple Daily. We had our last meal in Apple Daily in the canteen last night, and my boss said that he feels very, very proud that Apple Daily ended in this way because a lot of Hong Kong people support us. I think for other print media, if they have a death like this, no one will cry for it. But they will cry for Apple Daily. \ncrying\nJD: I’m sorry. I just feel so sad, you know? I’m so sorry, wait for a moment.\ncrying\nJD:  A lot of colleagues have been crying this week because we saw that our bosses and other colleagues were being sent to jail. It’s just so ridiculous. I mean, we are just reporters. And all the things we did were right. \nBW: I’m really moved by hearing that your mom, who had been critical of the paper, texted you saying that she was proud of you and understood the symbol of what this newspaper meant and what its closure means about what’s happening to Hong Kong. My understanding is that over the past two week there was another major raid in the newsroom with five executives getting arrested. Were you there that day and did you witness it?\nJD: No. When I woke up, the first thing that I saw on my phone was the notification, saying that our colleagues were arrested. That was last Friday, right?  It feels like a year already. So many things happen within this week. So last Friday, because the policemen were in our company they blocked all entrances and exits. We couldn’t be inside unless we were in the company at that moment. So I went back there at like 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. that day, and when I got back to my seat, I found that my seat was raided. It was totally raided. They took my hard disk.\nBW: Did they take your computer? \nJD: Yes.\nBW: What was the last story that you were working on before they took your computer and your hard drive. Do you remember?\nJD: I was working on some education stories, and it’s very interesting because I had saved my transcript on the drive as a word document, and after they took my drive, I realized that I had to re-do the whole thing. \nSo the transcript is like 10,000 Chinese words and I had to retype all of them. And it was really stressful because on Monday we were told that the last day is today. We heard the news this past Monday. So I had to re-do the whole thing at a super crazy pace because I had to rush before the death of our newspaper. \nBW: I saw some really moving videos online of people applauding the editors. And I saw pictures of what looked like dozens, maybe hundreds of people on staff on the roof of the building. Did you participate in all of that?\nJD: Yes. I’m one of them. We went onto the roof because we knew that there were a lot of readers and supporters who were standing outside our company and they were waving their mobile phone lights and saying something like, ‘Cheer up’ and  ‘We’ll keep fighting for Apple Daily.’ They kept shouting stuff like this to encourage the people who are working in Apple Daily, and we could really hear them. It was a very touching moment. And then we turned on our lights as well, and we also shouted things like, ‘Hong Kongers, Keep Going’ and ‘Never Give Up.’ Things like that. \nBW: The last thing I want to ask you is a big question. For people that are listening to this who maybe have never heard of Apple Daily or don’t know that much about Hong Kong, what do you want them to understand about what this newspaper means and what its closing signifies for where Hong Kong is heading?\nJD: Freedom of press is really so important to upholding justice and democracy in our society. If you do not have this power, who can speak the truth and who can monitor the government and the people who are in charge and have power? No one can do that if you don’t have freedom of press. I really respect my colleagues. They just want to keep going. Even if they are being sent into jail, they will still hold their pencil very tightly. And even when they imagine that, ‘Maybe tomorrow I'll be sent into a jail,’ what they are thinking in their mind is that they want to finish what they haven't finished. They want to finish the whole article even if they have to finish it from jail. This really touched me. I can see the persistence of my colleagues in Apple Daily, and I they really have my respect. People all around the world should respect these very brave journalists as well. I hope people, not only those in Hong Kong, can understand what happened in Apple Daily and also treasure what they have in their own home country as well.  \nBW: I just want to say that I have the most profound and deep respect for you and for all of your colleagues, and one of the reasons that I wanted to talk to you is because the values that you are articulating so movingly and powerfully right now, the values that democracy is based on, that are being taken away from you and other Hong Kong people, are the ones that I think too many people in my country often take for granted. And so it’s very powerful to hear them articulated by someone who is sacrificing for them and who was part of a company and an institution that did so much over the past 26 years to uphold those values. You have my utmost respect and admiration and that whenever you decide you want to pick up your pencil again, you have a home with me.\nJD: Thank you so much.","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e6ca1f5-c6a8-4e0b-b9da-124fda83ff7a_4150x2767.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Bari Weiss","content":"My conversation with an intrepid Apple Daily reporter.","contentSnippet":"My conversation with an intrepid Apple Daily reporter.","guid":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/bearing-witness-to-the-end-of-hong","isoDate":"2021-06-27T07:07:51.000Z","itunes":{}},{"creator":"Abigail Shrier","title":"The Books Are Already Burning","link":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/the-books-are-already-burning","pubDate":"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:33:33 GMT","content:encoded":"<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-971-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8ac350e-4dd5-4bc2-bf34-20740eade1de_5103x3402.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8ac350e-4dd5-4bc2-bf34-20740eade1de_5103x3402.jpeg\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8ac350e-4dd5-4bc2-bf34-20740eade1de_5103x3402.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:5631309,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.68956043956044%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.68956043956044%, 971px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-971-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 971px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">(<a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;photographer=ullstein+bild\">ullstein bild</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Do you remember the names Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying?&nbsp; I wrote <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/opinion/when-the-left-turns-on-its-own.html\">one of my earliest New York Times columns</a> about the bravery they displayed as tenured professors &#8212; words that do not typically appear in the same sentence&nbsp; &#8212; at Evergreen State College.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It was 2017 and the professors, both evolutionary biologists, opposed the school&#8217;s &#8220;Day of Absence,&#8221; in which white students were asked to leave campus for the day.

A question hangs over them: Will activists let them read it?</p><p>The book is mine <em>&#8212;</em> <em>Irreversible Damage &#8212;</em> and it is an investigation of a medical mystery: Why is the number of teenage girls requesting (and obtaining) gender reassignment skyrocketing in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Europe? In Great Britain, it&#8217;s up 4,400% over the last decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it shouldn&#8217;t be, this has become a highly controversial area of inquiry. The book is an exploration of why so many girls would, in such a short timeframe, decide they are transgender. And it raises questions about whether they&#8217;re getting appropriate medical treatment.</p><p>The book is not about whether trans people exist. They do. And it is not about adults who elect to medically transition genders. As I have stated endlessly in public interviews and in Senate testimony, I fully support medical transition for mature adults and believe that transgender individuals should live openly without fear or stigma.</p><p>Yet since publication, I have faced fierce opposition &#8212; not just to the ideas presented, challenged, or explored &#8212; but to the publication of the book itself. A top lawyer for the ACLU <a href=\"https://www.iwf.org/2020/11/16/some-in-aclu-have-new-cause-book-banning\">called for it to be banned</a>. Powerful organizations like GLAAD have lobbied against it and pressured corporations &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/does-the-aclu-want-to-ban-my-book-11605475898\">Target </a>and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-enforces-trans-orthodoxy-11592865818\">Amazon</a> among others &#8212; to remove <em>Irreversible Damage </em>from their virtual shelves.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#8217;s a pattern to such censorship campaigns. A fresh example presented itself this past week at <a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/\">Science-Based Medicine</a>, which bills itself as &#8220;a group blog exploring issues and controversies in the relationship between science in medicine.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>On Tuesday, one of the blog&#8217;s long-time contributors, Dr. Harriet Hall &#8212; a family physician and flight surgeon in the Air Force with dozens of publications to her name &#8212; posted a favorable review of my book. She examined the scientific claims as well as the medical ones and wrote that the book &#8220;combines well-researched facts with horrifying stories about botched surgeries, people who later regret their choices and therapists who are not providing therapy but just validating their patient&#8217;s self-diagnosis.&#8221; Dr. Hall not only shared my criticisms of &#8220;affirmative care&#8221; &#8212; that is, immediately agreeing with a teen&#8217;s self-diagnosis of gender dysphoria and proceeding to hormones and surgeries &#8212; but also noted that many physicians and therapists feel the same way but are afraid to say so.</p><p>Within a day, Dr. Hall&#8217;s article was flooded with nearly 1,000 comments, mostly, she says, from activists demanding the article be stripped from the site, but also from some readers expressing their appreciation. Angry emails from activists swamped the blog&#8217;s editors. Within two days, those editors had given Dr. Hall an ultimatum: retract, rewrite, or allow them to add a disclaimer.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;What surprised me was that my fellow editors attacked me, too. Basically what they said was that my article was not up to my usual standards as far as medicine, science and critical thinking went. And I didn&#8217;t feel that I did anything but what I always do. That surprised me,&#8221; she told me. Considering the editors&#8217; ultimatum, she elected to have the editors who disagreed add a disclaimer to the website. &#8220;I told them I did not want it retracted. And the next thing I knew, they had retracted it.&#8221;</p><p>Let that sink in: a book review by a respected <a href=\"https://www.scienceinmedicine.org/fellows/Hall.html\">physician</a> was <a href=\"https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/irreversible-damage-the-transgender-craze-seducing-our-daughters/\">bullied out of existence</a> in America.</p><p>Public figures who have watched the success of such campaigns &#8212; and they are now weekly if not daily &#8212; now know they risk their livelihoods by engaging heterodox views. Jordan Peterson, for example, chose to demonetize the interview we did on his YouTube channel to, in his words, &#8220;avoid attracting counterproductive attention by jackals who weaponize demonetization.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#8217;s not only corporations facing this type of activist pressure. Public libraries now do, too.</p><p>Halifax Pride, the annual LGBTQ festival, announced late last month that it would cut ties with the city&#8217;s library system over its insistence on carrying <em>Irreversible Damage</em>, calling it &#8220;transphobic,&#8221; and <a href=\"https://www.halifaxpride.com/news/2021/5/28/halifax-public-library-response\">claiming</a> that it &#8220;jeopardizes the safety of trans youth&#8221; and &#8220;debates the existence of trans people.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, the Halifax Public Libraries have resisted. Their position is straightforward and apolitical: libraries exist to expose the public to the widest array of views, &#8220;including those which may be regarded as unorthodox or unpopular with the majority.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The Halifax Public Libraries tried to compromise with the activists by pasting a note inside the book&#8217;s cover, directing readers to a list of &#8220;trans-affirming&#8221; resources. But the activists were unappeased. No ties with the libraries were restored. They want the book gone from the library and scrubbed from existence. Two copies in a library of nearly 1.2 million volumes are two too many.</p><p>Not even the Nova Scotia Library Association or the Canadian Library Association has come to the library&#8217;s defense, though their standing orders explicitly require member libraries &#8220;to guarantee and facilitate access to all expressions of knowledge and intellectual activity, including those which some elements of society may consider to be unconventional, unpopular or unacceptable.&#8221;</p><p>Silent supporters stand alongside the Halifax Libraries. They sign up to borrow the book, now nearly 150 of them, and post supportive messages on Twitter usually under pseudonyms.They know that the activists waging this battle &#8212; over who gets to determine what we can read, what ideas adults are allowed to explore, will, at some point, come for ideas they favor, or causes they support.&nbsp;</p><p>But like too many individuals and institutions who try to hold fast to liberal values in the face of an intolerant and illiberal onslaught, the Halifax Libraries stand alone in the public square.</p><p>I know how they feel.</p><div><hr></div><p>Half of Twitter seems to think I'm some sort of demon. But if you read my inbox, you&#8217;d think I was popular, awash as I am in secret fan mail and &#8220;silent supporter&#8221; notes.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is an entirely typical example &#8212; one of hundreds I&#8217;ve received over the last year:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Hi, Mrs. Shrier, I just wanted to drop you a quick note thanking you for your bravery. It might surprise you to know that I work for a prominent progressive politician (obviously I could never express my support for your work publicly). But it should be known that not everyone on the Left has totally lost their mind.</p></blockquote><p>The author turned out to be a senior staffer for a popular 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. But the email itself was a version that I&#8217;ve come to expect:&nbsp; <em>I agree with you, though I couldn&#8217;t possibly say so publicly. I have a job to think of, a reputation to uphold, children to put through college, a mortgage to pay, promotions to gun for, a spouse to please, friendships to maintain. </em>All of the trappings of a comfortable life<em>.&nbsp;</em></p><p>Child and adult psychologists and psychiatrists write to say they have witnessed a surge in transgender identification among teen girls who seem to be acting under peer and social media influence. Teachers write to say they believe that the phenomenon is plainly an example of social contagion within their classrooms. Surgeons and pediatricians and endocrinologists write to wonder aloud at what has happened to their profession.</p><p>There are lawyers who posit that lawsuits are on the way &#8212; brought by others, presumably. Professors who have come to hate their jobs &#8212; you can&#8217;t discuss your own research without trampling on a young generation&#8217;s vast neural network of sensitivities. Journalists at our most storied newspapers, TV networks, and literary magazines, even at NPR, write to tell me they liked my book, they agree with it, and to tut-tut the abuse directed at me. They assure me that the horrible accusations &#8212; from child predation to white supremacy and transphobia &#8212; accusations that will forever live on the internet, blackening my name, are things no one <em>really </em>believes. They wish &#8212; wish! &#8212; they could say so publicly. Each of these notes has touched or boosted me at times when I&#8217;ve needed it.&nbsp;</p><p>The fear these silent supporters express is rational. Even the most ordinary comments can get you branded as persona non grata, some flavor of &#8216;phobe&#8217; or &#8216;ist.&#8217; Hardly a week goes by without a story of some professor being reprimanded, a starlet losing a job, or a young reality TV figure abjectly apologizing for something he said that was completely obvious and true. Others have faced more profound threats &#8212; parents to the <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/transgender-identifying-adolescents-threats-to-parental-rights\">custody</a> of their children, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/06/03/author-andy-ngo-says-he-was-beaten-by-mob-in-portland/\">journalists</a> and even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1403695409177018372\">editors</a> of scientific journals to their physical safety. People I respect have lost <a href=\"http://bbc.com/news/uk-57426579\">livelihoods</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.ie/news/6685262/graham-linehan-house-of-lords/\">marriages</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, for over a year, I responded to those silent supporters with thanks and reassurance. <em>You don&#8217;t have to speak out, just send me your documents &#8212; I will expose it for you. No need to stand up for me publicly, just tell me what you know.</em> For a while, this seemed a decent bargain.</p><p>But then, a few months ago, a pediatrician reached out to say that she also thought it was insane that minors were <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/elfyscott/transgender-teens-shouldnt-have-to-wait-to-start-hormones\">self-prescribing</a> testosterone and that she agreed that her profession was negligent in unquestioningly &#8220;affirming&#8221; the sudden trans-identification of teenagers.&nbsp;</p><p>The standard response didn&#8217;t cut it this time. I wrote back as politely as I could: <em>That&#8217;s just not good enough.</em> You are a doctor. We aren&#8217;t the same with regard to medical scandals. I can continue to seek and publish the truth. I can interview experts and report what they&#8217;ve said. But <em>you </em>can appeal to your own authority. <em>You</em> took a Hippocratic oath. If <em>you </em>see young patients in harm&#8217;s way, <em>you</em> have an obligation to do something.</p><p>The same is true for other professions. If you are a teacher, you entered the profession in order to expand young minds. If you are watching them being <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fairforall_org/status/1402369253785968650\">warped</a>, it&#8217;s your responsibility to fight that. If you are a journalist witnessing lies being spread by your colleagues, it&#8217;s your responsibility to stand up for truth<em>. </em>If you are a professor, watching your colleagues being bullied &#8212; a med school professor watching hokum being peddled as fact, a scientist watching the corruption of research &#8212; there&#8217;s no one else to speak up but you.&nbsp;</p><p>Each of us knows this in theory. But why do so few oppose the pressure, lies, and the corrupting force of these bullying campaigns?</p><p>The silent supporters have each performed the same risk-benefit calculation and arrived at the same conclusion: Speaking up isn&#8217;t worth it. It could cost a job, reputation, peace and friends &#8212; it requires the assumption of risk and a willingness to sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And it is easy to justify our silence. We tell ourselves that we are protecting our families by remaining quiet and in the short-term, and we may be. But we are also handing our children over to a culture in which freedom of conscience and expression are drowned out. We are teaching our children that truth shouldn&#8217;t be our primary concern &#8212; or at least, that truth is negotiable or subordinate to being agreeable. They are learning that it is more important to remain acceptable to the powerful than to be truly free.</p><p>Whether or not most people admit it, what keeps them from speaking up in the face of what they know is wrong is fear. Fear not primarily of unemployment, though that is a pressing concern, but fear of ostracism. This deep and ancient fear is behind our desperate reach for innocence and safety when we virtue signal. By contrast, we stand exposed when we speak unpopular truth. Within your tribe, there will be people who pull away from you, and if you think well of them &#8212; and sadly, even if you don&#8217;t &#8212; this causes pain.&nbsp;</p><p>The pain is measurable and real, as Professor Kip Williams, an expert on ostracism, told me: &#8220;When people say their feelings are hurt, or they're feeling heartbroken, or they're feeling punched in the gut because of what their partner did, then you think its a metaphor. But in fact, it's the same feeling physiologically. You're having the same effects. And the brain detects it as pain.&#8221; We feel real physical pain at being cast out by a social group.</p><p>So terrible is this fear and this pain that in ancient Rome, a person sentenced to death could <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/exile-law\">opt for exile</a> instead. The Romans understood that ostracism was a punishment as bad as death.&nbsp;</p><p>What can make it bearable? According to Professor Williams, getting yourself accepted by another group. This is also the way to confront most of life&#8217;s heartaches &#8212; surrounded by those you love. And there is no better way to gain respect from those you don&#8217;t already know than by being identified with truthfulness.</p><p>Fear of ostracism is rational.&nbsp; But we are now living in a world in which evolutionary biologists are <a href=\"https://taibbi.substack.com/p/why-has-ivermectin-become-a-dirty-7bd\">threatened with losing their platforms</a> for engaging in debate about the source and treatment of a deadly virus; in which prize-winning composers have been <a href=\"https://reason.com/2021/06/15/daniel-elder-cancel-culture-choral-composer-antifa-blm-gia/\">professionally ruined</a> for saying arson is bad; in which authors are editing already-published books to <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2021/06/elin-hilderbrand-casey-mcquiston-antisemitism-israel-social-media.html\">placate online mobs</a>. That should scare us far more than losing friends or status.</p><p>So look to the Halifax Library. Summon what faith you can in those things you know to be right and true: a person is not defined by her race; biological sex is real; scientific research requires ideologically unencumbered investigation; activists shouldn&#8217;t bully libraries; and books should not be banned.&nbsp;</p><p>The first hundred or so silent supporter emails meant the most to me. They made me feel less crazy and less alone. But the inescapable reality is that defeating this ideology will take courage. And courage is not something that can happen in private. Courage requires each one of us to speak up, publicly, for what we believe in. Even when &#8212; especially when &#8212; it carries costs.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p><em><strong>You can follow Abigail Shrier&#8217;s work <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AbigailShrier\">here</a>.&nbsp;</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>As of this weekend, Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying are streaming their show via Odysee, a blockchain alternative to YouTube.

You can imagine what followed. For questioning a day of racial segregation wearing the garments of social justice, the pair was smeared as racist. Following serious threats, they left town for a time with their children, lost many of their friends, and, ultimately, resigned their jobs. \nBut they refused to shut up.\nThey started a podcast called DarkHorse, where they suggested in April 2020 that Covid-19 could have come from the lab in Wuhan — a position that made them a laughingstock among so-called experts more than a year before Jon Stewart talked about it on The Late Show.\nTheir willingness to challenge conventional wisdom and take on third-rail subjects has drawn them a large audience: Last month, DarkHorse had almost five million views on YouTube. But speaking freely has come with a price. The couple’s two YouTube channels have each received several warnings and one official strike, which the company says was because of their advocacy of the drug ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19. Three strikes from YouTube and a channel can be deleted. According to Weinstein, that would mean the loss of “more than half of our income.” \nHow have we gotten here? How have we gotten to the point where having conversations about important scientific and medical subjects requires such a high level of personal risk? How have we accepted a reality in which Big Tech can carry out the digital equivalent of book burnings? And why is it that so few people are speaking up against the status quo?\nI can’t think of a person better situated to answer these questions than Abigail Shrier, the author of today’s guest essay.\nYou may have heard of Shrier. She is the author of Irreversible Damage, which the Economist named one of the best books of last year, and a dogged journalist who has taken on the difficult and thankless subject of the enormous rise of gender dysphoria among teenage girls.\nI say thankless because it’s hard to capture the decibel of the vitriol that has met her work. To give you a taste: one of the ACLU’s most prominent lawyers said that “stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on.” (The subject of how the ACLU came to favor book banning is taken up brilliantly here.) And this is to say nothing of the personal defamation of Shrier’s character, smears that bear zero relationship to my courageous friend.\nYou do not need to agree with Shrier about whether or not children should be able to medically transition genders without their parents’ permission (she is opposed), or for that matter with Weinstein and Heying’s bullishness about ivermectin (I had never heard of of the drug before they put it on my radar). That’s not the point. The point is that the questions they ask are not just legitimate, they are of critical importance. Meantime, some of the most powerful forces in our culture are conspiring to silence them.\nThat is precisely the reason it is so important to stand up and say: no. To say: progress comes only when we have the freedom to disagree. To say: It is outrageous that tech platforms are censoring such debates and that some journalists are cheering them on. To say, in public: enough. In my case, that means making sure to publish those voices who have been shut out of so many other channels that ought to be open to them. \n                                                                                                                                         — BW\n\n\nOne hundred and forty-six people in Halifax, Nova Scotia wait on a list to borrow a library book. A question hangs over them: Will activists let them read it?\nThe book is mine — Irreversible Damage — and it is an investigation of a medical mystery: Why is the number of teenage girls requesting (and obtaining) gender reassignment skyrocketing in the United States, Canada, Scandinavia and Europe? In Great Britain, it’s up 4,400% over the last decade. \nThough it shouldn’t be, this has become a highly controversial area of inquiry. The book is an exploration of why so many girls would, in such a short timeframe, decide they are transgender. And it raises questions about whether they’re getting appropriate medical treatment.\nThe book is not about whether trans people exist. They do. And it is not about adults who elect to medically transition genders. As I have stated endlessly in public interviews and in Senate testimony, I fully support medical transition for mature adults and believe that transgender individuals should live openly without fear or stigma.\nYet since publication, I have faced fierce opposition — not just to the ideas presented, challenged, or explored — but to the publication of the book itself. A top lawyer for the ACLU called for it to be banned. Powerful organizations like GLAAD have lobbied against it and pressured corporations — Target and Amazon among others — to remove Irreversible Damage from their virtual shelves. \nThere’s a pattern to such censorship campaigns. A fresh example presented itself this past week at Science-Based Medicine, which bills itself as “a group blog exploring issues and controversies in the relationship between science in medicine.” \nOn Tuesday, one of the blog’s long-time contributors, Dr. Harriet Hall — a family physician and flight surgeon in the Air Force with dozens of publications to her name — posted a favorable review of my book. She examined the scientific claims as well as the medical ones and wrote that the book “combines well-researched facts with horrifying stories about botched surgeries, people who later regret their choices and therapists who are not providing therapy but just validating their patient’s self-diagnosis.” Dr. Hall not only shared my criticisms of “affirmative care” — that is, immediately agreeing with a teen’s self-diagnosis of gender dysphoria and proceeding to hormones and surgeries — but also noted that many physicians and therapists feel the same way but are afraid to say so.\nWithin a day, Dr. Hall’s article was flooded with nearly 1,000 comments, mostly, she says, from activists demanding the article be stripped from the site, but also from some readers expressing their appreciation. Angry emails from activists swamped the blog’s editors. Within two days, those editors had given Dr. Hall an ultimatum: retract, rewrite, or allow them to add a disclaimer. \n“What surprised me was that my fellow editors attacked me, too. Basically what they said was that my article was not up to my usual standards as far as medicine, science and critical thinking went. And I didn’t feel that I did anything but what I always do. That surprised me,” she told me. Considering the editors’ ultimatum, she elected to have the editors who disagreed add a disclaimer to the website. “I told them I did not want it retracted. And the next thing I knew, they had retracted it.”\nLet that sink in: a book review by a respected physician was bullied out of existence in America.\nPublic figures who have watched the success of such campaigns — and they are now weekly if not daily — now know they risk their livelihoods by engaging heterodox views. Jordan Peterson, for example, chose to demonetize the interview we did on his YouTube channel to, in his words, “avoid attracting counterproductive attention by jackals who weaponize demonetization.” \nIt’s not only corporations facing this type of activist pressure. Public libraries now do, too.\nHalifax Pride, the annual LGBTQ festival, announced late last month that it would cut ties with the city’s library system over its insistence on carrying Irreversible Damage, calling it “transphobic,” and claiming that it “jeopardizes the safety of trans youth” and “debates the existence of trans people.” \nSo far, the Halifax Public Libraries have resisted. Their position is straightforward and apolitical: libraries exist to expose the public to the widest array of views, “including those which may be regarded as unorthodox or unpopular with the majority.” \nThe Halifax Public Libraries tried to compromise with the activists by pasting a note inside the book’s cover, directing readers to a list of “trans-affirming” resources. But the activists were unappeased. No ties with the libraries were restored. They want the book gone from the library and scrubbed from existence. Two copies in a library of nearly 1.2 million volumes are two too many.\nNot even the Nova Scotia Library Association or the Canadian Library Association has come to the library’s defense, though their standing orders explicitly require member libraries “to guarantee and facilitate access to all expressions of knowledge and intellectual activity, including those which some elements of society may consider to be unconventional, unpopular or unacceptable.”\nSilent supporters stand alongside the Halifax Libraries. They sign up to borrow the book, now nearly 150 of them, and post supportive messages on Twitter usually under pseudonyms.They know that the activists waging this battle — over who gets to determine what we can read, what ideas adults are allowed to explore, will, at some point, come for ideas they favor, or causes they support. \nBut like too many individuals and institutions who try to hold fast to liberal values in the face of an intolerant and illiberal onslaught, the Halifax Libraries stand alone in the public square.\nI know how they feel.\n\n\nHalf of Twitter seems to think I'm some sort of demon. But if you read my inbox, you’d think I was popular, awash as I am in secret fan mail and “silent supporter” notes. \nHere is an entirely typical example — one of hundreds I’ve received over the last year: \n\nHi, Mrs. Shrier, I just wanted to drop you a quick note thanking you for your bravery. It might surprise you to know that I work for a prominent progressive politician (obviously I could never express my support for your work publicly). But it should be known that not everyone on the Left has totally lost their mind.\n\nThe author turned out to be a senior staffer for a popular 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. But the email itself was a version that I’ve come to expect:  I agree with you, though I couldn’t possibly say so publicly. I have a job to think of, a reputation to uphold, children to put through college, a mortgage to pay, promotions to gun for, a spouse to please, friendships to maintain. All of the trappings of a comfortable life. \nChild and adult psychologists and psychiatrists write to say they have witnessed a surge in transgender identification among teen girls who seem to be acting under peer and social media influence. Teachers write to say they believe that the phenomenon is plainly an example of social contagion within their classrooms. Surgeons and pediatricians and endocrinologists write to wonder aloud at what has happened to their profession.\nThere are lawyers who posit that lawsuits are on the way — brought by others, presumably. Professors who have come to hate their jobs — you can’t discuss your own research without trampling on a young generation’s vast neural network of sensitivities. Journalists at our most storied newspapers, TV networks, and literary magazines, even at NPR, write to tell me they liked my book, they agree with it, and to tut-tut the abuse directed at me. They assure me that the horrible accusations — from child predation to white supremacy and transphobia — accusations that will forever live on the internet, blackening my name, are things no one really believes. They wish — wish! — they could say so publicly. Each of these notes has touched or boosted me at times when I’ve needed it. \nThe fear these silent supporters express is rational. Even the most ordinary comments can get you branded as persona non grata, some flavor of ‘phobe’ or ‘ist.’ Hardly a week goes by without a story of some professor being reprimanded, a starlet losing a job, or a young reality TV figure abjectly apologizing for something he said that was completely obvious and true. Others have faced more profound threats — parents to the custody of their children, journalists and even editors of scientific journals to their physical safety. People I respect have lost livelihoods and marriages. \nAnd so, for over a year, I responded to those silent supporters with thanks and reassurance. You don’t have to speak out, just send me your documents — I will expose it for you. No need to stand up for me publicly, just tell me what you know. For a while, this seemed a decent bargain.\nBut then, a few months ago, a pediatrician reached out to say that she also thought it was insane that minors were self-prescribing testosterone and that she agreed that her profession was negligent in unquestioningly “affirming” the sudden trans-identification of teenagers. \nThe standard response didn’t cut it this time. I wrote back as politely as I could: That’s just not good enough. You are a doctor. We aren’t the same with regard to medical scandals. I can continue to seek and publish the truth. I can interview experts and report what they’ve said. But you can appeal to your own authority. You took a Hippocratic oath. If you see young patients in harm’s way, you have an obligation to do something.\nThe same is true for other professions. If you are a teacher, you entered the profession in order to expand young minds. If you are watching them being warped, it’s your responsibility to fight that. If you are a journalist witnessing lies being spread by your colleagues, it’s your responsibility to stand up for truth. If you are a professor, watching your colleagues being bullied — a med school professor watching hokum being peddled as fact, a scientist watching the corruption of research — there’s no one else to speak up but you. \nEach of us knows this in theory. But why do so few oppose the pressure, lies, and the corrupting force of these bullying campaigns?\nThe silent supporters have each performed the same risk-benefit calculation and arrived at the same conclusion: Speaking up isn’t worth it.

First: Thank you to everyone who has listened and subscribed and shared and reviewed our first episode this week. Your support means the world to me and our team, and we are incredibly grateful.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven&#8217;t heard it, please go check it out. It&#8217;s about the transformative moment that we&#8217;re living through, a moment that is changing every single one of us. In a few days I'll be bringing you another episode on how we got here, with a former CIA analyst who really saw it all coming.&nbsp;</p><p>But for now, I wanted to share this conversation I had a few days ago with billionaire investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban. The morning we recorded, ProPublica had dropped this big investigation into just how little federal income taxes billionaires in America pay. And I wanted to ask a billionaire why we shouldn't just...eat him.</p><p>We also talked about the point of having &#8220;fuck you money,&#8221; compassionate capitalism, cryptocurrency, trickle-down and trickle-up, selling garbage bags and buying an NBA team, Section 230, AI, virtual humans, TikTok, the one percent, ranked-choice voting, universal basic income, NFTs, burning down the political parties, and . . . my dad.</p><p>So we covered a lot of ground.</p><p>I promised you when I launched this podcast the kind of searching, authentic conversations that often happen these days behind closed doors. And that phenomenon, this kind of double-think, of saying one thing privately and another thing in public -- it is nowhere more apparent to me than among the ultra-rich. Now on the one hand, it makes sense: they have the most to lose. On the other hand: isn't this exactly what having money and power is for? The ability to say what you really think, the ability to take that risk?</p><p>And I can't think of a subject where the stakes are higher -- and where the gap between what people know is right and what they do in the name of the bottom line -- than the subject of China.</p><p>All of these American corporations -- Apple, Coca-Cola, the NBA, you name it -- they pride themselves on words like diversity and inclusion and justice. And yet they are struck with a curious silence when it comes to the subject of Chinese Communist Party and its ongoing genocide agains the Uighurs, among so many other abuses. I pressed Mark hard on this topic, and it was definitely the most heated and the most important part of our conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the many things I enjoy about Mark is his un-sentimentality and his lack of nostalgia. He&#8217;s obsessed with the future and with new technology. Where I feel fear and trepidation about how they&#8217;re changing what it means to be human, he mostly sees potential.</p><p>I&#8217;m excited to share this conversation with you, and we&#8217;ll be back in a few days&#8217; time.</p><p>Here&#8217;s Mark Cuban.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Mark Cuban, welcome to the podcast.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Thanks for having me, Bari, I appreciate it.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So before we get into it, Mark, I just need to ask you a really hard hitting question, which is: who is a tougher boss, Mark Cuban or Merle Monseen?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong><em>(laughs)</em></p><p><strong>BW</strong>: So for those who don't know the name Merle Monseen, this is not a famous billionaire investor you haven't heard of. It was Mark's boss at a summer camp -- a summer camp --</p><p><strong>MC:</strong><em>(laughs)</em></p><p><strong>BW: </strong><em>(laughs)</em> -- in Morgantown, West Virginia called Emma Farm, now called Emma Kaufmann, where many people that I love went --</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>-- many people from Pittsburgh, which is where Mark grew up, including my dad, who worked with the horse guys.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>And I think, Mark, you were the <em>assistant</em> maintenance man -- not even the maintenance man, is that right?</p><p><strong>MC:</strong><em>(laughs)</em> Yeah!I worked at the canteen one year and was the assistant maintenance guy the other year, my freshman and sophomore years in college.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So I kind of want to start there because for most people who encounter you in the world, you're Mark Cuban, you are Dallas Mavericks, you are Shark Tank. But you started off as not just as the <em>assistant</em> maintenance man in Morgantown, West Virginia. You know, from pretty humble beginnings in Pittsburgh, the town where I'm from. So as I understand it, this all started for you with garbage bags. Do I have that right?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yeah, my dad did upholstery on cars. So if you had a rip in your car seat or you had a convertible that was messed up, you would take it to my dad&#8217;s -- where my dad worked, Regency Products, and they would work on it. You know, did backbreaking work, lost an eye in an accident when a bolt or something broke when he was working on a car. Just brutal work. And my mom, housewife and odd jobs. And so when I was like 12 years old, my dad and his buddies were playing poker and drinking and yucking it up. And I went in probably to grab a donut. And I remember asking my dad if I can get a new pair of basketball shoes, because I was hardcore into basketball back then. And he was like, &#8220;Mark, you see those tennis shoes on your feet? They still work. When you have a job, you can buy whatever you want, but until then, you got shoes.&#8221; And I'm like, &#8220;Dad, I'm twelve! I can't get a job.&#8221; And one of his buddies who was probably drunk at the poker table said, &#8220;I got a job for you. I've got all these boxes of garbage bags that you can sell here in the neighborhood.&#8221; And I'm like, &#8220;Dad, can I do that?&#8221; And he&#8217;s like, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; So literally, I would go door to door in Scott Township in Birdland, south hills of Pittsburgh, and say, &#8220;Hey, my name is Mark. I'm your neighbor. Do you use garbage bags?&#8221;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong><em>(laughs)</em></p><p><strong>MC: </strong>And I probably had the world's first and only and last door-to-door garbage bag subscription service. And so I did that for a little bit, til I got my shoes. But that was probably a big impetus in my early entrepreneurial days.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>And what was the markup on the garbage bags?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Hundred percent.</p><p><em>(both laugh)</em></p><p><strong>MC:</strong> I bought a box of one hundred for three dollars and sold them for six.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>And people bought them, rather than just going to the -- the store.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>How could you say no to me?</p><p><em>(both laugh)</em></p><p><strong>MC:</strong> No, it was, it was really -- I learned a lot of lessons, I mean, because obviously it was something that everybody needed, and you could buy a box and they were cheap. Actually, the true answer is they were cheap garbage bags. But, you know, you just put them somewhere and use them till you were done. You give me a call and I'd bring you more. It was great.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Garbage bags are something everyone needs. The other thing everyone needs are newspapers, or at least they used to. And, you know, they say that behind every great fortune is a great crime. And I'd love if you could enlighten me --</p><p><strong>MC: </strong><em>(laughs) </em>Oh, a great crime! Thanks, Bari!</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Here&#8217;s the great crime. What went down in Cleveland, Ohio with the honor box when the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette went on strike?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>OK.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>How did your little young capitalist mind exploit that strike?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Way to throw me under the bus. When the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette went on strike, I was sixteen. And me, &#8220;To the Pro&#8221; -- you know, because in high school we all had nicknames -- Toe the Pro, Bofi, and a couple of other guys, we piled into my 1966 Buick LeSabre that my dad bought for fifty dollars. And the shocking part was that the car made it there and back. We drove to Cleveland and we bought newspapers and <em>maybe</em> when we put a quarter into the newspaper box, we took out more than one newspaper. I guess back then it was a dime, sorry. We took out more than one newspaper. <em>Maybe</em>.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong><em>(laughs)</em></p><p><strong>MC: </strong>And <em>maybe</em> we stopped the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper truck and got a discount for buying all of them so he wouldn't have to make his deliveries and could take the time off. And then we packed &#8216;em in our car, drove back to Pittsburgh, got back in time for the morning rush hour. And I was standing on the corner selling papers that, give or take, I bought for a dime each for fifty cents each.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So, you know, I guess what we would call the garbage bag business or, you know, the short-lived one-day newspaper business -- they're small businesses --</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>And, you know, we think of America being built on businesses like that.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yep.</p><p><strong>BW:</strong> But right now, things seem really, really rough if you're a small business owner, especially when you look at the past year in which, you know, businesses like Amazon absolutely crushed and hundreds of thousands of local stores closed for good.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Mmhmm.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So give me the big picture on that. How do small businesses possibly compete with the likes of behemoths like Amazon?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Oh, it's the same thing that I've always done as a small business person over the years. When you run with the elephants, there&#8217;s the quick and the dead. You have to be faster. You have to be more agile. You have to always be learning. And as new things happen, you have to be able to adapt. That's just the nature of small business, because whether it's Amazon or pick any era, there's always been a behemoth that dominated. Maybe it was Sears. And then Sears put out a catalog in the early 1900s that disrupted local businesses. Maybe it was Wal-Mart that started with one store and grew. Competing against bigger entities is inevitable when you're a small business. And so those businesses that are agile can grow -- if they choose to, can stay the same size. But, you know, it all comes down to the customer. If you make your customers happy and you give them better value, they're going to do business with you. And so, you know where I have businesses that compete with Amazon, we have to be a lot more responsive and agile because we know Amazon's going to screw up all the time and we know there's going to be customers that appreciate our products. And for those businesses that don't evolve, they will lose. But that happens all the time. You know, there's always going to be an Amazon and Amazon will get Amazon-ed at some point.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So you don&#8217;t see. So there's a lot of people that look at companies like Amazon or Facebook and say this is different. These are monopolistic in a way that Sears or Wal-Mart or any of the companies that you just mentioned ever were. But you see a through line. You don't see them being materially different.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I think Amazon is different, right? Yeah, there's things that I would change about Amazon that I think they probably shouldn't do and maybe there's a regulatory issue. And so, you know, when they knock off a product, not that knockoffs aren't happening in every industry, but that's probably something that's going to work against them in the long run, either regulatorily or when there's an alternative. People will remember that and say, you know what, Amazon I don't like the way they did this or this. So I'm going to switch to another provider for whatever the product is. Facebook's a different beast. The way that they generate advertising revenue is different than selling a product and the way that they play to people's fears and insecurities and their I basically artificial intelligence basically recognizes those fears and insecurities that people may not even know they have as they used Facebook. I think that's a real problem and that's created some instability in this country and I think it needs to be dealt with.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I really want to get to AI with you in a moment, later in the conversation. But before we get to that, one thing that strikes me about living in the world that Amazon and Facebook have made is it feels sometimes a little bit to me like a sci fi movie, like sci fi movies where everyone wears the same outfit and every place they go sort of looks the same. And I feel increasingly like I'm living in that world. Like I go into a coffee shop in L.A. or Austin or New York or increasingly anywhere in the world or an Airbnb or an office space. And it all looks the same aesthetically, like they all have the same macrame wall hanging and millennial pink. And I guess, do you worry that we're moving toward a kind of like as we've become unbelievably connected, that it's sort of flattened everything--</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>No.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>No. OK, tell me why.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Because I think there's so much change occurring right now. Look at what's happening with cryptocurrency and currency is the wrong word. Look what's happening within the crypto universe. There are communities being built around these crypto ethos that didn't exist before that are disruptive, just on the edge, just in a tiny bit now, but in a growing manner, traditional finance, traditional everything for that matter. And you see these communities rallying because it's very laissez faire from the bottom up as opposed to the top down. And I think that's incredibly powerful. I think it's going to have a significant impact on our politics in this country, in the world. And it's just now starting to be recognized. So when you look at things like what happened with GameStop or AMC and the stock market where the little guy dominated the big guy and the big guy lost billions, that's one indication when you look at what's happening with Dogecoin in the cryptocurrency world and these communities rallied together, starting just with forums, but then they go on to become viral. And, you know, whether it's on TikTok or Reddit forums or wherever it may be, Facebook, you know, you're seeing people say, you know what, I might be able to make some money on this. I might be able to use it as a currency. And they're changing their behaviors and they're taking a different attitude towards how they see their financial future and how they live their lives, for that matter. So I think that homogenization probably was happening. But these communities that are unifying themselves around financial gains and financial goals is significant. And I really, truly think it's changing the world. And if you start digging into cryptocurrency, there's this thing called DAOs. Distributed autonomous organizations where rather than these new entrepreneurial businesses being set up as traditional companies where entrepreneurs get the majority of stock, maybe they give some stock to employees. What happens is they're using tokens that aren't equities, they're not stock, but they're enablers. And with tokenomics, the way the tokens are distributed, nobody is allowed to have more than 50% because by design, they don't want control going into, you know, one person or a few people's hands. They want the control to be defined by the community. And you're starting to see these types of organizations really become financially successful and the gains being split by all the participants. And the more you participate, the more you contribute in the community, the more money you can make. And that bottom up approach is so game-changing and different that it's only going to expand. And the cool part about it, it's very far left progressive because it's bottom up, but it's also very laissez faire because it's very entrepreneurially driven.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So one thing that interests me about AMC and GameStop and the examples you're pointing to is. That they're super shaped by virality and this idea of going viral and in a way, at least in my mind, and you'll tell me if you think this is a tenuous connection, you sort of set that in motion with Broadcast.com, which was this early business of yours that pioneered livestream. Right. And it feels like to me, we live in a world now where everything is livestream-ed. And it went from, you know, we can livestream this Indiana college basketball game to we can livestream this Victoria's Secret event that before maybe only rich people can see. But now, like, wow, I am getting told by a 19 year old TikToker, you know, that I need to go to Starbucks and order this ridiculously complicated drink order. And I find myself doing it and then I'm streaming myself, getting the drink order. It's like we're all sort of living on our own-- not to sound too stoner-y-- but like our own self-produced reality show. And I wonder, like our own simulations. So, do you think of yourself as having played that role or maybe to put it in another way as having unleashed a kind of monster?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Absolutely, because that was the mission, the mission was to stream everything live and then make it available on demand. Remember, this is 1995 and I can't tell you when we started talking about calling net casting or Internet broadcasting back then, people just laughed at us. Oh, my God. It was like, wait, &#8216;You want this thing called the Internet? And I have to get a dial up modem. I have to buy a subscription to a dial up Internet provider. I have to download a TCP IP client. I have to download this media player. Then I have to find your website. Then I have to connect to this batch file. Then I have to hope the stream works. You want me to go through all of that instead of turning on my TV? Are you fucking kidding me?&#8217; They all thought I was crazy and. But we knew that things would get better, faster, cheaper and simpler. So when we first got started, because it was so bizarre and different, we started with sports because people wanted to be able to get out-of-market sports. So if you're a Pirates fan, you could get the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team games live around the world. And that was a big driver of participation. But we also streamed weddings. People created their own comedy shows. Anything that people would allow us to live stream, we streamed. We don't care what it was because it was the ultimate longtail. And we knew that over time, the technology, as I said, would get better, faster, cheaper. And obviously it did. And it was just a question of time before it became mainstream.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Do you have any regrets about the world that you've unleashed in that way, like the fact--&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Oh, of course not. No, no. Look, you know, it wasn't like if I didn&#8217;t do it, someone else wouldn't have done it. Technology marches on. You know, my dad used to say all the time, &#8216;You don't live in the world you were born into; and all of us, you know, ten years older or older, there's so much change in technology and just short periods of time that either we do it or somebody else does it. But there's no way to put the genie back in the bottle. It's just not going to happen.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Well, given your dad's wisdom, it's kind of the perfect segway to talk about the C word. Capitalism. In your life, it sounds like capitalism is this, &#8216;duh&#8217; you know, this very positive thing, super obvious. For a lot of people in my generation, you know, who&#8217;ve lived through the Great Recession, the student debt crisis, who can't afford to buy a home, who have less wealth than their parents. They seem to have beef with capitalism. And, you know, you see parents in one of the richest countries in the world crowd funding health care for their toddler surgeries. And people look at that and they think, you know, even those of us who are, you know, inclined toward capitalism, who see it as I do, as lifting people out of poverty, you see that and you think something is really wrong here. Do you see what those people see? Do you see where they&#8217;re coming from?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Because something is very wrong.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>And what is wrong.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>What is wrong is that there are always going to be opportunists. There are always going to be people who try to take advantage of circumstances. And you saw that with the financial crisis in 2008, 2009. Then you've got politicians who further enable that through the way they regulate things. But at the same time, when things go to extremes, there is a response to it. You know, capitalism is meant to be very malleable. You know, it's not, you know, take as much money from everybody as you can and, you know, &#8216;Screw them, who cares what happens to them.&#8217; That's not capitalism. That's just greed. And that's not that's not a structural problem. That's a personal problem for individuals. And that's unfortunate. And I think in response to what happened and what has continued to happen in some cases with people who just put greed first, the capitalist side of me says that creates opportunity. So there are ways to change the healthcare system. There are ways that you can work bottom up. We talked about some of the crypto currencies. There are ways where you can be a compassionate capitalist and there's ways that, you know, you have to look at socialism and other alternatives and say, OK, do you at least consider them and what's the logic behind why you don't adopt them? And I think, you know, capitalism, compassionate capitalism, as I would say, is still a better solution than socialism or communism or other isms.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>What do you mean when you say compassionate capitalism? How do we build a compassionately capitalistic system? Does that mean a better social safety net or?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>That's part of it. But when everybody has more than the people with more, get even more, right. In other words, When we suck money out of the system through subprime mortgages and people who shouldn't have gotten mortgages, were given mortgages, and the whole system came close to being fully delevered, meaning that people who took out loans weren't able to pay them back and they had to sell their houses and their possessions to try to pay them back. That severely damaged the economy and a generation, as you point out, and that doesn't pay benefits to those at the top or the bottom. Compassionate capitalism means when people at the bottom have more, they can spend more. And great companies, great entrepreneurs benefit more, as do their stakeholders. And so that's why I'm a big proponent and have done it in my companies for, you know, over the past four or five years of a 15 dollar minimum wage. And I've spoken very publicly about that. You know, I went through in my companies to me, you know, one of the great embarrassments for an entrepreneur or a company owner is that you don't pay your employees enough to not have to take social services or to to any type of grant programs, you know, where they need external government support in order to live their lives. You know, meaning you're underpaying them. To me, that's the worst indication, you know, or the worst thing that can happen to a company. And it's embarrassing. It's not like people will admit if they're getting government support. But we tried to estimate, you know, what we needed to pay our people and we gave them raises above and beyond that, because that to me is compassionate capitalism, because the stronger the bottom, the wealthier the top, everybody gets the benefit.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So we're, as AOC is called, capitalism irredeemable. You're saying this competitive system is still a net good, but those that are involved in it need to make sure that the people at the bottom are cared for sufficiently. And, you know, some people are arguing like you for the 15 dollar minimum wage. Others have other solutions, like Andrew Yang arguing for a universal basic income. Just so curious, what do you think about that?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>You know, I like UBI for caretakers, right? If you are a caretaker for your parent or for a child, yes, I think it's a strong fit there. I think it's a disincentive in a lot of respects. But it really comes down to how much you know, there's plenty of examples where people are getting a thousand dollars or 1500 dollars in UBI and they point to those examples of those people who still work and continue to be productive. I'd rather see a guaranteed job program where people have that option, other than caretakers, as I just mentioned, but there's a job available to anybody who needs it. You know, there's plenty of things that we can do as the government that create jobs, particularly when unemployment gets to record levels. So I'm not generally in favor of UBI. I am generally in favor of a federal job program. Let's call it a transitional federal job program when unemployment is high.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Let's go from talking about the people at the bottom who need UBI, need a 15 dollar minimum wage to the people at the top. One of the things that I think feels so just honestly bad right now in American life is the fact that one percent of Americans hold more wealth than the bottom 92 percent and the 50 richest people in this country own more than the bottom 165 million people. And that's staggering. So just today, as we're recording this, ProPublica just began releasing the tax secrets, I'm sure you saw it, of the wealthiest people in the country. And, you know, just just to choose one or two data points, Jeff Bezos paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2007 and 2011, Elon Musk in 2018. In other years, it was Michael Bloomberg, George Soros. I'm just curious, what do you think of that report? Do you anticipate that you're going to be a part of it?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I mean, I think it's very misleading. I think the misleading part of it, there's a difference between income and net worth. If your house escalates in value significantly, you probably didn't do anything to increase the value of your house. It just grew because of the demand in the marketplace, maybe you lived in the right spot. Maybe there was a change in the area you lived in and prices escalated. Based on ProPublica and what they wrote, everybody whose house goes above a certain valuation should pay taxes on that valuation. Now, most people don't have the liquidity to pay those taxes. It's not like paying your property tax at two percent with a threshold limit. And so what ProPublica basically said is because stock valuations went up significantly, not because of anything those companies did, Amazon or any of them, for that matter, those prices in those valuations and even housing prices have gone up significantly because in response to the pandemic and the risk of an economic crash, interest rates went to zero. And when interest rates go to zero, you get appreciable assets appreciating faster and to extreme levels. And so while, you know, the amounts that were published are staggering in so many respects, the data you refer to is correct, and it's also staggering, it's not money in their pocket. It's not like, &#8216;OK, I can go spend that money.&#8217; They have to sell their shares of stock first, and chances are the minute they sell them, the value of those things go down significantly. That's part one. Part two, when interest rates go up, those valuations, those share valuations are going to go down fast and they're going to go down hard. And if you pay taxes on those, then all of a sudden, OK, are you going to rebate them back? You know, because let's just say, you know, Jeff Bezos stock is valued at a trillion dollars and you tax him at one percent and that one percent of a trillion dollars is ten billion dollars and you force him to write a check for ten billion dollars. Well, now he's got to sell some of that stock. OK, so be it. But then let's say interest rates, because the economy overheats in response, go up to 10 percent and the value of a stock goes from one trillion down to one billion. It's happened before. Now, all of a sudden, he's written the check the previous year or two years ago for 10 billion. Now he's worth a billion, and does the government refund the delta? Since you use valuations based off of just, you know, mark to market pricing? There's all kinds of intricacies. Look. I&#8217;m the luckiest motherfucker in the world, right? I have more money than I ever possibly dreamed of. Do I have more money than one person deserves? Probably. Can I make all kinds of excuses for what I'll do with that money? Yeah, but the reality is nobody's entitled to all this. It takes luck to get to that amount of money. And, you know, like I said, I was plenty lucky because the stock market went to extreme highs and I was smart enough to protect it rather than be greedy and think it's going to keep on going up. But the point I was getting to, if I'm worth X billions of dollars, I don't have that in cash. I might have just a small percentage of that in actual cash. And the rest is in investments and companies and entrepreneurs that I've invested in, in programs that I've invested in. And so if now all of a sudden, you know, you're taxing me on my net worth, I'm going to have to sell things. And that may not be bad to 99.98 percent of the population, but it will change the economics of taxation and the valuation of the assets that people have. And so it's a tricky formula. It's difficult to try to find the right solution for that. And so, you know, when Elizabeth Warren talks about wealth tax, it's not that I'm against taxing me more. Right. I paid 29 percent, I think, last year in income taxes and 19 percent the year before. You know, I'm not opposed to paying more in taxes at all. But I think, you know, in terms of regulation, you want to build from the bottom up, because the other thing that we know, no matter how much you take from me, Jeff Bezos or whatever, putting it through the government, by the time it trickles down to people who need it, most of its gone.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So just to just to put this in the plainest language possible, you're saying that what looks like a great injustice, what generates all of these outrage headlines, they're actually part of just a much more complicated story about how the ultra rich go about managing their massive wealth in our current regulatory system.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yeah, I wouldn&#8217;t even say how we go about managing our massive wealth. I'm just saying a lot of it's just contextual and circumstantial, right? If there was not a pandemic which caused interest rates to go to actually zero or below, in some cases, you would not have seen those gains. Or if interest rates for any reason remained at three, four or five percent, those gains wouldn't be in existence if interest rates go up to eight, nine, ten percent, those gains disappear. So the numbers that they're pinpointing as being an injustice are very fleeting numbers, they go up because interest rates go down and they go down when interest rates go up. And so taxing them creates other types of problems that create a situation that's not sustainable. And let me add to that again, that just extracting that money from us and again, I'm not against paying more taxes and I've said this many times, is not necessarily going to help anybody at the bottom because the efficiency of the government getting it there trickle-down is very difficult. Trickle up works. Right. Trickle down does not work. And I think the real response should be &#8216;How can we get appreciable assets into more people's hands?&#8217; Can we regulate so that people who work in companies that go public, you know, there's a ratio between the amount of stock that the CEO is granted or the C suite is granted and the amount of stock that every other employee, you know, from the least paid hourly employee, how much stock do they get so that when interest rates go down, they benefit as well? You know, whatever the percentage of income and again, I've said these things many times. Yes. Whatever the percentage of the income that is assigned in stock allocations to a CEO, that percentage of income in stock allocations should be assigned to the employee earning the least. Because when you give people appreciable assets, as these things evolve in our economy and the global economy, everybody benefits at least proportionately the same. You know, in my companies, everybody that I've ever started, everybody's gotten stock. And every time I've sold a company, they've benefited proportionately. They didn't have as much stock as I did because I took the risk up front or invested my money up front. But all the employees got shares of stock. 300 out of 330 employees of Broadcast.com when we sold it became millionaires, many of them earning ten dollars an hour. And so it's something that I did in practice, and I think it's something that works. It's not about tearing down, it's about building up. And we can't look at the government as being efficient in how they transfer wealth. We've got to find better ways and look at the things that made people like me rich and make those available to people at the lowest pay levels so that they can increase their net worth. And so they don't face the same challenges and risks that your generation is.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So obviously, you're one of the leads on one of my favorite shows, which is Shark Tank. And I've heard you say that one of your main goals in doing the show is educating people about finance. And I am including myself very much in this as someone in their mid-30s who just got their first real credit card, like the financial literacy in this country is so poor. I would just love to hear you on, quickly because there's so many things I want to get to, what are the top three things that individuals can do for themselves right now when it comes to basic financial literacy and making smart decisions with their money?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Number one, pay off your credit cards because your credit card company, once you go past 30 days, is going to charge you an obscene amount of interest and you only lose. You can't make that amount of interest fast enough. You can't earn enough income fast enough to pay off those bills. And I know that's easier said than done. Trust me, I've had more than a few credit cards cut up. I've had more than a few days where I won't pick up my phone because of the bill collectors. So I've been there. But you've got to avoid taking on debt that goes past thirty days. That is first and foremost. And then if you are able to save any amount of money, learn about cryptocurrency and in particular something called decentralized finance, because cryptocurrencies are changing the banking game. And just like, you know, if you were to ask me about the future of technology in 1995, I would have told you about the Internet. And now the future of technology and finance is something called decentralized finance. And instead of making point zero two percent on your savings, you can make four or five, eight, 10 percent on your savings. That's what I'm doing with my money, where I have available cash. And I think it's something smart for everybody to learn about.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>What's the third thing?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>You know what I've always tried? There was a book I read called &#8216;The Best Investment Guide You'll Ever Need&#8217;, and this book is 30 years old. And the whole premise of the book is that being a smart shopper is the best way to invest. And so if you're able to buy, you know, toothpaste on sale at 50 percent off at the dollar store, that's a great investment because you're making 50 percent on money you otherwise would be spending on toothpaste. Same with toilet paper. Anything that you can find enough space under your bed. You know, I lived with six guys in a three bedroom apartment and didn't have my own room, all I had was a pile. And I still would like to have my little trash bag full of shit and I put stuff in there that I could buy cheap. And, you know, that's what I recommend to anybody, because whatever you save on a consumable that you use on an ongoing basis, that's real savings. That's real money.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I want to talk about the idea of fuck you money, because the whole concept, right, is you work your ass off, you make a pile of money, and then you get to say fuck you to people and you get to actually say what you want. In fact, I have seen the actual opposite of that being true in the world. One of the themes of the show is being honest in public about what we really think. I find that the people that have nothing to lose, young people, poor people are most courageous about saying what they really think and that the more fuck you money a person gets, the more they're captured by that money and that the people who tend to be the most double thinking, saying the truth in private and saying something different in public. The people who are most scared to say what they think out loud are the people in the C Suite, they're the people with the most power. I'm wondering if you've noticed that paradox.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Of course, but only in the social media era, because if you're in a C suite and, you know, by definition you're running a company, you are at the top of a company, and so it's not just about you. You know, the perception of your brand, the perception of your products and services are going to be influenced by what's said on social media. And so, you know, when I first made my biggest money after we sold Broapdcast.com and I was able to get to a point where I was liquid somewhat, then it was different. I could say, fuck you to everybody. And I did.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Who would you say it to first?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>When I bought the Dallas Mavericks, I mean, the whole NBA. You know, I got fined more than anybody, you know, to this day. And I didn't give a shit what anybody thought. I was just going to do what I thought was right. And, you know, I've done it in business my entire career. With social media changes it now, instead of just saying, fuck you to somebody, I can just tweet something and get my point across knowing that, you know, half the people who respond to that, we are going to say, fuck you right back to me. And so that's really what's changed it more than anything else.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So this next question I want to ask you is really about the point of having money and the point of having power. And I want to say that this is not a gotcha question. I'm not trying to bait you. And I'm asking this because I admire you and I admire you because honestly, you're authentic and principled and human. And this question is about China, where I have real cognitive dissonance. You're Jewish, as I am and your grandparents immigrated from Russia and Romania, a quarter of your mother's family were murdered by the Nazis. And the stories coming out of China to me feel very similar to what happened under the Nazis, concentration camps, forced labor, forced sterilization, torture, rape and the NBA, and they're not alone, so many other American corporations are the same, are making hundreds of millions of dollars from the Chinese market. And I would argue that the league has made it impossible for anyone associated with the NBA to speak out about these atrocities being committed by the Chinese Communist Party. And the reason for that is obvious. It's because they don't want to lose the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I&#8217;ve come out against what&#8217;s happening to the Uyghurs and said it's awful, it's horrible. There's no other way to explain it. There's no justification for it. It's wrong.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>OK, I guess I feel like, you know, when Daryl Morey to choose one example, who was the GM of the Houston Rockets when he tweeted &#8216;Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong&#8217;, and then you have LeBron James saying that he wasn't educated on the situation at hand. You had a moment a few months ago where if you went on NBA dotcom, you couldn't order a jersey that said &#8216;Free Hong Kong&#8217;, but you could order one that said, &#8216;Fuck America.&#8217; Like we know that there is a tremendous moral hypocrisy happening here, and I fail to understand why this isn't the hill that everyone wants to die on. Why isn't this the battle worth picking? Isn't this exactly what power and money is for?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>There's a lot of different answers for that. But the reality is, you know, the domestic politics effectively of China or any country for that matter, right? Why are we not talking about Myanmar?. Why are we not talking about atrocities in Africa? And I'm not trying to play what-about-ism? But what it comes down to is the unfortunate reality of this world is, you know, there are atrocities across the globe and we can't be the arbiter and we can't be the regulator of all of them, you know, as business people.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Right. But what we can decide if we're running a Hollywood studio not to edit the movie in order to suit the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>, I mean, we're not editing anything. With the NBA we sell them content and if anything, you know, we hope that we send messages of who we are and we can influence their culture. And by creating a void, we lose that opportunity. And look, there's no winning answer to this. There's not an answer I can give you that this is the one right way to do it. It's not simple, right? And just like if you go over there and they look at American culture, they'll give you 20 reasons why things we do here are all wrong, and it should be a hill that they die on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>But you wouldn't draw that kind of... you don't buy that cultural relativism, obviously.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Meaning?</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>You're right that the Chinese Communist Party would say that. But I'm making sure that you're not buying that argument.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Oh, no, no, no. I'm not saying what they're saying is accurate. Right. What I'm saying is that when it comes to domestic politics of other countries, you know it's very, very difficult for a company organization, even an individual, to take stands on all of them. And look, you know, we put in place, I think, rules in terms of the vendors that we work with and where their products are created. And that's important. And we've done that. You don't want, you know, things coming out of that region, the Xinjiang region, to be sold. And, you know, those are things that we do. But, you know, I haven't taken a stand on other countries' domestic policies, and that's not something I'm going to do.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>But like, you know, the concentration camps in Nazi Germany, someone could make the argument that that was just Germany's domestic policy.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yes, they could. Right. And what I'm saying, we're talking about just different business things and try to be as clear as I can, that any of the atrocities that are happening to Uyghurs, or in that region are wrong. And the question then becomes, as a country, what steps do we want to take? Because, do we intervene? I don't know. You know, do you attack China? That's not a question for me to answer.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>You're right, I guess to me, the answer would be to put as much pressure economically, morally, rhetorically, diplomatically as possible, and it feels like we're so far away from that. I mean, the Olympics in 2024 are going to be in Beijing, right?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Again, there's a lot of ways that you can try to discuss the question, but how do you really affect change? You know, it's like talking about Amazon, right, in some respects. And I'm trying not to compare Amazon to China, but, you know, you're pissing in the wind at certain levels. And I get that if you want to aggregate impact, then it's important, but there's different ways to do it. There's diplomatic ways to do it and there's stronger ways to do it. But we have to come to an agreement as a country to do those things in order for them to have impact and just despairing approaches I don't think really gets anywhere.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Well, I don't think it's despairing. I think it's saying, you know, if we do nothing, if we accommodate the Chinese Communist Party--as you know, there was an incredible story in the Times a few weeks ago about Apple-- like, if we accommodate them, then lack of change is a foregone conclusion. I guess one last question on China and then I really want to talk to you about crypto. The idea about policy vis-&#224;-vis China, especially when I worked at the Wall Street Journal editorial page, was this idea that by liberalizing economic policy toward China that somehow free people would follow free markets. Right. That inevitably, you know, the trickle down effect of capitalism is something akin to liberal democracy. That's turned out not to be true. And I guess are you surprised by how that has played out? And did you used to believe in that wisdom, too?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>No.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>You&#8217;re not surprised.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Did I hope that it would work?It's just like anything else, you try it and either it works or it doesn't work, right? So did I hope it would work. Yes, of course. But China Inc. being run the way it is basically as a corporation, you know, they know how to compete. They do a better job of planning and they're smarter than communists were in the past. And so we have to recognize that and compete accordingly. And so, you know, we have to recognize that they've got plans for artificial intelligence and they have plans for their economy. They have plans to try to dominate globally. And we as a country have to find ways to compete with that. Otherwise, we'll find the sphere of influences having shifted dramatically. And that's the reality.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Well, let's talk about the future, because I'm really scared that China's going to own it. And your job, one of your key jobs, I think, is to see the future, to make bets on it. I'm curious about what your big bets are right now. It sounds like obviously, I know cryptocurrency is at the top of that list. What joins crypto?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Well, let me add the second thing is artificial intelligence, and that's going to drive everything because that has military implications, that has economic implications, that has health care implications. It's the fundamental competitive tool that we need to be better at China than that we need to be the best in the world at, in order to continue to be the strongest country in the world economically and militarily. And I think that's a good thing. And so we need to invest heavily. And I don't think the Trump administration fully understood it. I think the Biden administration is certainly getting their arms around it. But we're still not dealing with it from an educational perspective. And we need many, many more engineers. We need many more AI-literate people. I started the Mark Cuban AI boot camp where we go into underprivileged schools and we put on classes for kids from underprivileged schools to teach them about A.I. and try to get them excited about it. I invested in another company and I'm spacing their name, but all they do is provide advanced physics and other AP classes via Zoom, starting off in Mississippi, into underprivileged communities to try to get kids, you know, as young as twelve excited about learning, you know, science and A.I. and advanced topics like that where otherwise they'd have no access. If we don't improve our education, we're not going to be able to compete. We have two great assets in this country, the intellectual capital of our children, right how smart they are, how smart and driven they want to be and our entrepreneurial mindset. There's no country in the world like the United States that is as entrepreneurial as we are. You know, that's one of the reasons I do Shark Tank. I want people to get excited that there is a way to achieve the American dream, that starting a company is a good thing, that being innovative and creating new opportunities so that you can kick Amazon's ass, you can kick Wal-Mart's ass, you can kick China's ass, those are all good things, but they all start with education; first, middle and last. And so that's how we are going to compete. And to me, those are the things that we really need to to stay ahead on.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>OK, there's so many things I want to ask you about education, but I know that we're tight on time--</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>If you keep on going I&#8217;ll keep on going for you, Bari.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Oh, you're so sweet. I want to stick...well, OK, just one question on education like that all sounds amazing. And then I think about the past year and I, I feel like I want to laugh- cry because, you know, the idea of like poor kids in Mississippi learning about A.I. and programing and coding sounds unbelievable. And then you look at the rate of literacy in this country and basic math in this country and the fact that, you know, the teachers&#8217; unions control these schools. And I think that if any group was more beclowned this year, it would be them. And so I guess, you know, the big picture question for me is, is one about school choice and how passionately you feel about that issue?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I'm not passionate about it one way or another, honestly, it's not something I've really delved into. So it's not that I don't care. It's just that I'm not very literate on it. But I am very passionate about child care and child care support services and preschool and making sure kids don't go hungry, because if they're hungry, they're not going to learn. If they're living in squalor, they're not going to learn. I started the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, first time I ever put my name on a company, and effectively, we're going out, starting with generic drugs, sourcing them and manufacturing them wherever we can and selling them at cost plus 15 percent and being fully transparent and all our costs. And I mention that as it applies to kids, because the first drug that we chose was a drug called albendazole, which is the response for hookworm and all these different worming diseases. And those are prevalent, shockingly enough, still in rural Alabama and rural Texas. And kids get them because they're walking in sewage where they don't have appropriate sewage in their homes or in the Boys and Girls Club, wherever it may be. And so we're providing it for free to them. And, you know, the point is that we need to solve early stage development for kids because by the time they hit five, six, seven years old, if they're hungry and their parents weren't around because of work or didn't have jobs or, you know, have other issues, then we're fucked. And so as important as education is, setting up kids to be ready by the time they reach school to me is just as important. And so that's something that we need to solve.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Right, it's like how do we compete with China and remain this bastion of entrepreneurship where kids can have garbage bag businesses when the next generation, you know, has hookworm and doesn't know how to read?.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>One hundred percent. And so you can't solve them all at once. Right? You can try, certainly. But again, we need to stop thinking in terms of political dogma, whether it's Republican trickle down or Democratic, their version of trickle down, which is you write the check to the government and it trickles down to the people who need it. Neither one of them works. And we need to start thinking in terms of getting appreciable assets into families hands, as I mentioned earlier, so that as the economy evolves, they get to benefit from them, you know, livable wage, as Bernie Sanders says, you know, so that people can get their kids health, child care, you know, UBI for child care and caretakers, you know, so that parents, a parent can can be at home to properly, you know, spend time with their children, better schools. Those are the things that we need to do. And, you know--</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>This sounds like a stump speech. I mean that as a compliment. Like, you are articulating things in a way that... I'm looking at the mayoral race right now in New York and like, you know...&nbsp; would you ever run?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>No. Hell no. But I would tell you that the reason it works this way is not that Andrew Yang and others don't think about it and aren't literate on it. It's when you have a two party system, everything's going to be fucked up. And when you have a two party system that is built on primaries, you know, where most people don't vote and the people who vote are the most extreme, you know? And that's why, you know, it's interesting. I think one of the big fuckups of the New York mayoral race is they're not talking about rank choice voting at all. And the candidates aren't using it to their advantage that I've seen at all. You don't have to be, you know, the number one candidate initially, you could be the number two or maybe even number three candidate and pull votes from the bottom candidates and end up winning the election. And if we're you know, I wish the media and podcasts would cover RCV because rank choice voting takes out the extremes and the extreme candidate and diminishes the impact of the money that comes from the extremes and that's important, and we can't get to dealing with the real issues like we've been talking about unless we take the extremes out of primary voting.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So I think everyone can see that we're living in a time of extreme polarization and tribalism. One of the drivers of that is primaries. The other driver of that, I think, is social. And many people, you know, I think rightly blame the algorithm right all the time for fomenting the kind of outrage like it feels like we're in this perpetual outrage cycle. So going back to I, do you think that I can be built in such a way that it gives us less of the things that appeal to our strongest negative emotions?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Oh, yeah. That's not an AI problem. That's a Facebook problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>You don't think you don't think that's also a Twitter problem?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Less so. Less so. Right. Because maybe it's more--</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Not in my experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>No, it's not that Twitter can't be brutal. Right. I mean, absolutely brutal. I've been, all the worst of the worst of the dregs of the worst have attacked me on Twitter in huge numbers. But it's easier on Twitter just to set your feed so that it's chronological. And, you know, when you set it, so that it's picked by Twitter, you see a lot more of the garbage. If you set it to chronological order, you see a lot less of it. Whereas on Facebook, it's almost impossible just to get a pure feed. And Facebook optimizes for revenue more than Twitter does. And so when Facebook designs its A.I. and they build their models, you know, the fact that they amplify for revenue means you're going to get exposed to far more extremes and you're going to get exposed to things you may not even realize amp you up and make you use the service more. And I truly believe that there should be no Section 230 protections for any amplified post, meaning if something is artificially amplified for any reason, that means Facebook has made the decision to amplify that post via artificial intelligence, you should get no Section 230 protections. If it's just chronological, go for it.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>That's a really sophisticated, nuanced answer. I'm curious what you think about the idea that Clarence Thomas floated in that recent decision about thinking about companies like Facebook as something more like common carriers or public utilities, an idea that's been amplified by people like David Sacks?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>No, they're not. I mean, and that shows the lack of understanding of what's going on with artificial intelligence. They're not common carriers, not even close. You know, Facebook is ripe for disruption. You know, they're not, they've survived, I don't know, 16 years, you know, who knows how long they'll last. But there are issues with scale when you're being protected on posts that are not supposed to be protected if you influence them in any way. Right. If you act as a publisher in any way. And so those protections need to be taken away. And that changes fundamentally what Facebook is able to do.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>There are all kinds of theories and a lot of smart people love to say, you know, if we only fix X, everything would get better. You know, for some people it's racism. For others, it's the media. For others, wealth inequality or wokeness or political polarization. If you, Mark Cuban, very powerful man, could wave a magic wand, a wand maybe that you already have and correct a single problem. Which one would you choose?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>I mean, if I was going that's a long list, obviously. Health care should be at the top of the list. But to give you and there's things that I've worked on with health care and it's such a fucked up mess, but it's fixable. But I don't know that it's fixable in concept. I don't know if it's fixable in execution. And the reason it's not fixable is because of our political system. So if I was going to wave a magic wand, I would disintegrate both political parties and outlaw political parties.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Interesting, no political parties at all,</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>At all, because they no longer serve the purpose they once did, you know, in an era where it was difficult to communicate in communities, political parties had real value. But now we have so many options to create community, to create alliances, to, you know, come together as a group. All political parties have become is a platform for extremism and power. You know? How is it that Democrats always seem to vote monolithically in the House? How is that even possible? And same with Republicans. Now we see Joe Manchin not vote with all the other Democrats, and that's heresy. Then from that, we want to get rid of the filibuster. And it's like, hello, you don't think the Republicans are going to be just as extreme if the filibuster is gone when they get in power? I mean, it's just ridiculous. We have these politicians that leverage their party to amplify their power ss much as Facebook uses A.I. to amplify their posts for revenue, it's just wrong across the board. And it's not like the two parties give us the best candidate. There's an organization that I support called the Center for Competitive Democracy, and we've spent millions of dollars and all we do is work to help independents or small party candidates get on the ballot because the Democrats and Republicans, the one thing they'll work together on is to keep third party and independent candidates off the ballots. And it's not like the candidates that the two main parties propose and put up for us to vote on are typically great candidates and they get chosen because they're the best candidate. So to me, the two parties, you get rid of them, you get rid of parties, then all of a sudden you have people who hopefully get elected because they stand up for things that can help their communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>It's a little like the Imagine song from the Beatles. Like Imagine there's no countries Imagine there's no religion. Imagine there's no political parties. But it's almost like I don't think by outlawing political tribes, you get rid of the tribalism that's in all of us.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Oh, yeah, no. It changes dramatically because of the money involved, because the one thing parties do is they aggregate money and people and money can create power, particularly in politics. And because so few people participate, and particularly the primary process selects candidates from the extremes, you get rid of parties, you change all the dynamics, and people have to become supportive and hopefully become supportive based off of the idea or the concept or the implementation or the execution of it, you know, as opposed to my team, and that tribalism. We don't we don't need a Democratic team. We don't need a Republican team. We don't need a Green Party team. We need candidates that represent their constituents that will work for their constituents in the country.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Mark, one of your recent investments is in something called Virtual Humans, Dawg, which I spent a lot of time looking at last night. It is so scary and freaky. And I feel like I'm about to buy all of my clothes based on the advice of a sims. So can you explain to people what virtual humans is?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>It's making the real world partially simulation, I guess, where you can create synthetic people who take on personalities on social media. And because they're not real people, real people connect to them a little bit more easily because there's no consequence. You know, there's no consequence of what's going to happen when you see them in real life and they're, you know, virtualhumans.org is going to create a wide variety of those people and so that people will have people to talk to, you know, synthetic sims to talk to. And you add some chatbots and everything. Think of them as virtual pets, only in the shape of a human.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Well, in this shape, in the shape of a pin up. I mean, they all look like they're like...</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>They're all flawed. Right. They're all meant to have flaws and they're not meant to be some unattainable shape, form or look, they're really meant to be representative. And maybe what we have on this site right now is not fully representative. But the goal is that there's somebody that's going to be something like you and look a little bit like you for everybody.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>But I just look at it and I can't help but think like, oh my God, are we going the way of where no one has sex in real life and they just, like, fall in love with a simulated sex doll on the Internet?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yeah, that I don't have an answer to. It's going to be weird, there's no question about it. You combine artificial intelligence, you combine the ability to create the seemingly real characters, and you add that to social media where you can script a lot of it. It&#8217;s going to be weird. There's no question about it.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>I know that you are very into NFTs. I have spent a lot of time talking to very smart people who are also into NFTs. I need you to convince me that it's not just a screenshot because I don't understand what this is or why it's a real thing beyond just a fad like Pogs.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>It's just a digital collectible for the most part. Right. There are other business applications, but, you know, whatever it is that they're painting on your wall or that picture on your wall, whatever it is, you like it and you like to look at it. Now, look at your which do you look at more the picture on your wall. Let's say it's not a family picture. Let's just say it's just a painting or a landscape or whatever. Do you look at the things that are on your wall or the pictures on your phone more? Which do you value more? And so with an NFTs, it's just a digital asset that can be collected, traded, bought and sold, that's all.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>And do you think that this is going to be something that lots of us are going to get into? Or is this going to be a rarefied thing for the people that already have a Jeff Koons statue in their backyard?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>No collectibles are collectible. That's up to everybody. Why is a Picasso worth what it's worth? Why do some people like this art versus that art? That's just one one application of NFTs. It's really a proof of concept. But look at textbooks. You know, we're already used to buying digital books on Amazon, right? Many of us read on Kindle and it's no big deal to read online. Some of us prefer physical books. But think in terms of textbooks, what if we made textbooks into NFTs so that, you know, you're a college kid? And instead of trying to find a used book for your class, either in a used bookstore or online for a used book marketplace, it was just an NFT. You could print it out on a printer if you want, maybe even ship it if it gives you access to a physical book, but when your class is over, you just go on to the marketplace and you just sell that NFT for that textbook. You don't have to ship a physical book. You don't have to carry it somewhere. You don't have to grade it to see if pages are missing or anything like that. You just sell it when you're done or you have Cliff Notes for a class, you buy them for ten bucks, you use them during the class. It's an NFT, so when you're done with it, you go to opensea.io marketplace and you sell it. So there's a bunch of applications that will come up with NFTs that will simplify things and be more efficient.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>We are living in the weirdest time.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>OK, there's never a time that's not weird. Never.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>OK, but don't you think this is weirder than most?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>No, no. Let me just tell you, the early days of the Internet were insane and the technology going from analog to digital just freaked people out. The early days of the PC business, you know, where people thought they were all going to lose their jobs because a PC would take their place. The bookkeeper's spreadsheets. It always happens, Bari, and it always feels weird. Always. Twenty five years from now, you're going to look back at this and go, oh, my God, that was nothing, because A, B and C happened. That's just the way shit works. It makes it interesting. That's fucking life, you know, shit's fucked up, you know, in a lot of different ways. And we just try to do our best to minimize how it's fucked up and, you know, try to help ourselves, help our families and help other people.</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>So take us back to the South Hills to end it here. What are the values that you learned in our hometown that have taken you from there to where you are now?</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Yeah, the same values. I mean, my friends or my from back then, you know, the kids I worked at camp with Jerry and Todd and Stu, etc., you know, we learned hard work is good. You know, you can benefit from your own effort. And we learn to be nice that when you're nice to people, things work better and you can really have an impact. It may just be locally, but, you can have an impact on others if you're just nice. And I think that that's the greatest lesson. And then again, on top of that, the obvious, you know, love in your family and trying to cherish those people close to you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>BW: </strong>Mark Cuban, thank you so much.</p><p><strong>MC: </strong>Thanks Bari, it was fun. </p>","content:encodedSnippet":"BW: This is Honestly and I'm Bari Weiss. First: Thank you to everyone who has listened and subscribed and shared and reviewed our first episode this week. Your support means the world to me and our team, and we are incredibly grateful. \nIf you haven’t heard it, please go check it out. It’s about the transformative moment that we’re living through, a moment that is changing every single one of us. In a few days I'll be bringing you another episode on how we got here, with a former CIA analyst who really saw it all coming. \nBut for now, I wanted to share this conversation I had a few days ago with billionaire investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban. The morning we recorded, ProPublica had dropped this big investigation into just how little federal income taxes billionaires in America pay. And I wanted to ask a billionaire why we shouldn't just...eat him.\nWe also talked about the point of having “fuck you money,” compassionate capitalism, cryptocurrency, trickle-down and trickle-up, selling garbage bags and buying an NBA team, Section 230, AI, virtual humans, TikTok, the one percent, ranked-choice voting, universal basic income, NFTs, burning down the political parties, and . . . my dad.\nSo we covered a lot of ground.\nI promised you when I launched this podcast the kind of searching, authentic conversations that often happen these days behind closed doors. And that phenomenon, this kind of double-think, of saying one thing privately and another thing in public -- it is nowhere more apparent to me than among the ultra-rich. Now on the one hand, it makes sense: they have the most to lose. On the other hand: isn't this exactly what having money and power is for? The ability to say what you really think, the ability to take that risk?\nAnd I can't think of a subject where the stakes are higher -- and where the gap between what people know is right and what they do in the name of the bottom line -- than the subject of China.\nAll of these American corporations -- Apple, Coca-Cola, the NBA, you name it -- they pride themselves on words like diversity and inclusion and justice. And yet they are struck with a curious silence when it comes to the subject of Chinese Communist Party and its ongoing genocide agains the Uighurs, among so many other abuses. I pressed Mark hard on this topic, and it was definitely the most heated and the most important part of our conversation. \nOne of the many things I enjoy about Mark is his un-sentimentality and his lack of nostalgia. He’s obsessed with the future and with new technology. Where I feel fear and trepidation about how they’re changing what it means to be human, he mostly sees potential.\nI’m excited to share this conversation with you, and we’ll be back in a few days’ time.\nHere’s Mark Cuban.\nBW: Mark Cuban, welcome to the podcast.\nMC: Thanks for having me, Bari, I appreciate it.\nBW: So before we get into it, Mark, I just need to ask you a really hard hitting question, which is: who is a tougher boss, Mark Cuban or Merle Monseen?\nMC: (laughs)\nBW: So for those who don't know the name Merle Monseen, this is not a famous billionaire investor you haven't heard of. It was Mark's boss at a summer camp -- a summer camp --\nMC:(laughs)\nBW: (laughs) -- in Morgantown, West Virginia called Emma Farm, now called Emma Kaufmann, where many people that I love went --\nMC: Yep.\nBW: -- many people from Pittsburgh, which is where Mark grew up, including my dad, who worked with the horse guys.\nMC: Yep.\nBW: And I think, Mark, you were the assistant maintenance man -- not even the maintenance man, is that right?\nMC:(laughs) Yeah!I worked at the canteen one year and was the assistant maintenance guy the other year, my freshman and sophomore years in college.\nBW: So I kind of want to start there because for most people who encounter you in the world, you're Mark Cuban, you are Dallas Mavericks, you are Shark Tank. But you started off as not just as the assistant maintenance man in Morgantown, West Virginia. You know, from pretty humble beginnings in Pittsburgh, the town where I'm from. So as I understand it, this all started for you with garbage bags. Do I have that right?\nMC: Yeah, my dad did upholstery on cars. So if you had a rip in your car seat or you had a convertible that was messed up, you would take it to my dad’s -- where my dad worked, Regency Products, and they would work on it. You know, did backbreaking work, lost an eye in an accident when a bolt or something broke when he was working on a car. Just brutal work. And my mom, housewife and odd jobs. And so when I was like 12 years old, my dad and his buddies were playing poker and drinking and yucking it up. And I went in probably to grab a donut. And I remember asking my dad if I can get a new pair of basketball shoes, because I was hardcore into basketball back then. And he was like, “Mark, you see those tennis shoes on your feet? They still work. When you have a job, you can buy whatever you want, but until then, you got shoes.” And I'm like, “Dad, I'm twelve! I can't get a job.” And one of his buddies who was probably drunk at the poker table said, “I got a job for you. I've got all these boxes of garbage bags that you can sell here in the neighborhood.” And I'm like, “Dad, can I do that?” And he’s like, “Sure.” So literally, I would go door to door in Scott Township in Birdland, south hills of Pittsburgh, and say, “Hey, my name is Mark. I'm your neighbor. Do you use garbage bags?”\nBW: (laughs)\nMC: And I probably had the world's first and only and last door-to-door garbage bag subscription service. And so I did that for a little bit, til I got my shoes. But that was probably a big impetus in my early entrepreneurial days.\nBW: And what was the markup on the garbage bags?\nMC: Hundred percent.\n(both laugh)\nMC: I bought a box of one hundred for three dollars and sold them for six.\nBW: And people bought them, rather than just going to the -- the store.\nMC: How could you say no to me?\n(both laugh)\nMC: No, it was, it was really -- I learned a lot of lessons, I mean, because obviously it was something that everybody needed, and you could buy a box and they were cheap. Actually, the true answer is they were cheap garbage bags. But, you know, you just put them somewhere and use them till you were done. You give me a call and I'd bring you more. It was great.\nBW: Garbage bags are something everyone needs. The other thing everyone needs are newspapers, or at least they used to. And, you know, they say that behind every great fortune is a great crime. And I'd love if you could enlighten me --\nMC: (laughs) Oh, a great crime! Thanks, Bari!\nBW: Here’s the great crime. What went down in Cleveland, Ohio with the honor box when the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette went on strike?\nMC: OK.\nBW: How did your little young capitalist mind exploit that strike?\nMC: Way to throw me under the bus. When the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette went on strike, I was sixteen. And me, “To the Pro” -- you know, because in high school we all had nicknames -- Toe the Pro, Bofi, and a couple of other guys, we piled into my 1966 Buick LeSabre that my dad bought for fifty dollars. And the shocking part was that the car made it there and back. We drove to Cleveland and we bought newspapers and maybe when we put a quarter into the newspaper box, we took out more than one newspaper. I guess back then it was a dime, sorry. We took out more than one newspaper. Maybe.\nBW: (laughs)\nMC: And maybe we stopped the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper truck and got a discount for buying all of them so he wouldn't have to make his deliveries and could take the time off. And then we packed ‘em in our car, drove back to Pittsburgh, got back in time for the morning rush hour. And I was standing on the corner selling papers that, give or take, I bought for a dime each for fifty cents each.\nBW: So, you know, I guess what we would call the garbage bag business or, you know, the short-lived one-day newspaper business -- they're small businesses --\nMC: Yep.\nBW: And, you know, we think of America being built on businesses like that.\nMC: Yep.\nBW: But right now, things seem really, really rough if you're a small business owner, especially when you look at the past year in which, you know, businesses like Amazon absolutely crushed and hundreds of thousands of local stores closed for good.\nMC: Mmhmm.\nBW: So give me the big picture on that. How do small businesses possibly compete with the likes of behemoths like Amazon?\nMC: Oh, it's the same thing that I've always done as a small business person over the years. When you run with the elephants, there’s the quick and the dead. You have to be faster. You have to be more agile. You have to always be learning. And as new things happen, you have to be able to adapt. That's just the nature of small business, because whether it's Amazon or pick any era, there's always been a behemoth that dominated. Maybe it was Sears. And then Sears put out a catalog in the early 1900s that disrupted local businesses. Maybe it was Wal-Mart that started with one store and grew. Competing against bigger entities is inevitable when you're a small business. And so those businesses that are agile can grow -- if they choose to, can stay the same size. But, you know, it all comes down to the customer. If you make your customers happy and you give them better value, they're going to do business with you. And so, you know where I have businesses that compete with Amazon, we have to be a lot more responsive and agile because we know Amazon's going to screw up all the time and we know there's going to be customers that appreciate our products. And for those businesses that don't evolve, they will lose. But that happens all the time. You know, there's always going to be an Amazon and Amazon will get Amazon-ed at some point.\nBW: So you don’t see. So there's a lot of people that look at companies like Amazon or Facebook and say this is different. These are monopolistic in a way that Sears or Wal-Mart or any of the companies that you just mentioned ever were. But you see a through line. You don't see them being materially different.\nMC: I think Amazon is different, right? Yeah, there's things that I would change about Amazon that I think they probably shouldn't do and maybe there's a regulatory issue. And so, you know, when they knock off a product, not that knockoffs aren't happening in every industry, but that's probably something that's going to work against them in the long run, either regulatorily or when there's an alternative. People will remember that and say, you know what, Amazon I don't like the way they did this or this. So I'm going to switch to another provider for whatever the product is. Facebook's a different beast. The way that they generate advertising revenue is different than selling a product and the way that they play to people's fears and insecurities and their I basically artificial intelligence basically recognizes those fears and insecurities that people may not even know they have as they used Facebook. I think that's a real problem and that's created some instability in this country and I think it needs to be dealt with.\nBW: I really want to get to AI with you in a moment, later in the conversation. But before we get to that, one thing that strikes me about living in the world that Amazon and Facebook have made is it feels sometimes a little bit to me like a sci fi movie, like sci fi movies where everyone wears the same outfit and every place they go sort of looks the same. And I feel increasingly like I'm living in that world. Like I go into a coffee shop in L.A. or Austin or New York or increasingly anywhere in the world or an Airbnb or an office space. And it all looks the same aesthetically, like they all have the same macrame wall hanging and millennial pink. And I guess, do you worry that we're moving toward a kind of like as we've become unbelievably connected, that it's sort of flattened everything--\nMC: No. \nBW: No. OK, tell me why.\nMC: Because I think there's so much change occurring right now. Look at what's happening with cryptocurrency and currency is the wrong word. Look what's happening within the crypto universe. There are communities being built around these crypto ethos that didn't exist before that are disruptive, just on the edge, just in a tiny bit now, but in a growing manner, traditional finance, traditional everything for that matter. And you see these communities rallying because it's very laissez faire from the bottom up as opposed to the top down. And I think that's incredibly powerful. I think it's going to have a significant impact on our politics in this country, in the world. And it's just now starting to be recognized. So when you look at things like what happened with GameStop or AMC and the stock market where the little guy dominated the big guy and the big guy lost billions, that's one indication when you look at what's happening with Dogecoin in the cryptocurrency world and these communities rallied together, starting just with forums, but then they go on to become viral. And, you know, whether it's on TikTok or Reddit forums or wherever it may be, Facebook, you know, you're seeing people say, you know what, I might be able to make some money on this. I might be able to use it as a currency. And they're changing their behaviors and they're taking a different attitude towards how they see their financial future and how they live their lives, for that matter. So I think that homogenization probably was happening. But these communities that are unifying themselves around financial gains and financial goals is significant. And I really, truly think it's changing the world. And if you start digging into cryptocurrency, there's this thing called DAOs. Distributed autonomous organizations where rather than these new entrepreneurial businesses being set up as traditional companies where entrepreneurs get the majority of stock, maybe they give some stock to employees. What happens is they're using tokens that aren't equities, they're not stock, but they're enablers. And with tokenomics, the way the tokens are distributed, nobody is allowed to have more than 50% because by design, they don't want control going into, you know, one person or a few people's hands. They want the control to be defined by the community. And you're starting to see these types of organizations really become financially successful and the gains being split by all the participants. And the more you participate, the more you contribute in the community, the more money you can make. And that bottom up approach is so game-changing and different that it's only going to expand. And the cool part about it, it's very far left progressive because it's bottom up, but it's also very laissez faire because it's very entrepreneurially driven.\nBW: So one thing that interests me about AMC and GameStop and the examples you're pointing to is. That they're super shaped by virality and this idea of going viral and in a way, at least in my mind, and you'll tell me if you think this is a tenuous connection, you sort of set that in motion with Broadcast.com, which was this early business of yours that pioneered livestream. Right. And it feels like to me, we live in a world now where everything is livestream-ed. And it went from, you know, we can livestream this Indiana college basketball game to we can livestream this Victoria's Secret event that before maybe only rich people can see. But now, like, wow, I am getting told by a 19 year old TikToker, you know, that I need to go to Starbucks and order this ridiculously complicated drink order. And I find myself doing it and then I'm streaming myself, getting the drink order. It's like we're all sort of living on our own-- not to sound too stoner-y-- but like our own self-produced reality show. And I wonder, like our own simulations. So, do you think of yourself as having played that role or maybe to put it in another way as having unleashed a kind of monster?\nMC: Absolutely, because that was the mission, the mission was to stream everything live and then make it available on demand. Remember, this is 1995 and I can't tell you when we started talking about calling net casting or Internet broadcasting back then, people just laughed at us. Oh, my God. It was like, wait, ‘You want this thing called the Internet? And I have to get a dial up modem. I have to buy a subscription to a dial up Internet provider. I have to download a TCP IP client. I have to download this media player. Then I have to find your website. Then I have to connect to this batch file. Then I have to hope the stream works. You want me to go through all of that instead of turning on my TV? Are you fucking kidding me?’ They all thought I was crazy and. But we knew that things would get better, faster, cheaper and simpler. So when we first got started, because it was so bizarre and different, we started with sports because people wanted to be able to get out-of-market sports. So if you're a Pirates fan, you could get the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team games live around the world. And that was a big driver of participation. But we also streamed weddings. People created their own comedy shows. Anything that people would allow us to live stream, we streamed. We don't care what it was because it was the ultimate longtail. And we knew that over time, the technology, as I said, would get better, faster, cheaper. And obviously it did. And it was just a question of time before it became mainstream.\nBW: Do you have any regrets about the world that you've unleashed in that way, like the fact-- \nMC: Oh, of course not. No, no. Look, you know, it wasn't like if I didn’t do it, someone else wouldn't have done it. Technology marches on. You know, my dad used to say all the time, ‘You don't live in the world you were born into; and all of us, you know, ten years older or older, there's so much change in technology and just short periods of time that either we do it or somebody else does it. But there's no way to put the genie back in the bottle. It's just not going to happen.\nBW: Well, given your dad's wisdom, it's kind of the perfect segway to talk about the C word. Capitalism. In your life, it sounds like capitalism is this, ‘duh’ you know, this very positive thing, super obvious. For a lot of people in my generation, you know, who’ve lived through the Great Recession, the student debt crisis, who can't afford to buy a home, who have less wealth than their parents. They seem to have beef with capitalism. And, you know, you see parents in one of the richest countries in the world crowd funding health care for their toddler surgeries. And people look at that and they think, you know, even those of us who are, you know, inclined toward capitalism, who see it as I do, as lifting people out of poverty, you see that and you think something is really wrong here. Do you see what those people see? Do you see where they’re coming from?\nMC: Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Because something is very wrong.\nBW: And what is wrong.\nMC: What is wrong is that there are always going to be opportunists. There are always going to be people who try to take advantage of circumstances. And you saw that with the financial crisis in 2008, 2009. Then you've got politicians who further enable that through the way they regulate things. But at the same time, when things go to extremes, there is a response to it. You know, capitalism is meant to be very malleable. You know, it's not, you know, take as much money from everybody as you can and, you know, ‘Screw them, who cares what happens to them.’ That's not capitalism. That's just greed. And that's not that's not a structural problem. That's a personal problem for individuals. And that's unfortunate. And I think in response to what happened and what has continued to happen in some cases with people who just put greed first, the capitalist side of me says that creates opportunity. So there are ways to change the healthcare system. There are ways that you can work bottom up. We talked about some of the crypto currencies. There are ways where you can be a compassionate capitalist and there's ways that, you know, you have to look at socialism and other alternatives and say, OK, do you at least consider them and what's the logic behind why you don't adopt them? And I think, you know, capitalism, compassionate capitalism, as I would say, is still a better solution than socialism or communism or other isms.\nBW: What do you mean when you say compassionate capitalism? How do we build a compassionately capitalistic system? Does that mean a better social safety net or?\nMC: That's part of it. But when everybody has more than the people with more, get even more, right. In other words, When we suck money out of the system through subprime mortgages and people who shouldn't have gotten mortgages, were given mortgages, and the whole system came close to being fully delevered, meaning that people who took out loans weren't able to pay them back and they had to sell their houses and their possessions to try to pay them back. That severely damaged the economy and a generation, as you point out, and that doesn't pay benefits to those at the top or the bottom. Compassionate capitalism means when people at the bottom have more, they can spend more. And great companies, great entrepreneurs benefit more, as do their stakeholders. And so that's why I'm a big proponent and have done it in my companies for, you know, over the past four or five years of a 15 dollar minimum wage. And I've spoken very publicly about that. You know, I went through in my companies to me, you know, one of the great embarrassments for an entrepreneur or a company owner is that you don't pay your employees enough to not have to take social services or to to any type of grant programs, you know, where they need external government support in order to live their lives. You know, meaning you're underpaying them. To me, that's the worst indication, you know, or the worst thing that can happen to a company. And it's embarrassing. It's not like people will admit if they're getting government support. But we tried to estimate, you know, what we needed to pay our people and we gave them raises above and beyond that, because that to me is compassionate capitalism, because the stronger the bottom, the wealthier the top, everybody gets the benefit.\nBW: So we're, as AOC is called, capitalism irredeemable. You're saying this competitive system is still a net good, but those that are involved in it need to make sure that the people at the bottom are cared for sufficiently. And, you know, some people are arguing like you for the 15 dollar minimum wage. Others have other solutions, like Andrew Yang arguing for a universal basic income. Just so curious, what do you think about that?\nMC: You know, I like UBI for caretakers, right? If you are a caretaker for your parent or for a child, yes, I think it's a strong fit there. I think it's a disincentive in a lot of respects. But it really comes down to how much you know, there's plenty of examples where people are getting a thousand dollars or 1500 dollars in UBI and they point to those examples of those people who still work and continue to be productive. I'd rather see a guaranteed job program where people have that option, other than caretakers, as I just mentioned, but there's a job available to anybody who needs it. You know, there's plenty of things that we can do as the government that create jobs, particularly when unemployment gets to record levels. So I'm not generally in favor of UBI. I am generally in favor of a federal job program. Let's call it a transitional federal job program when unemployment is high.\nBW: Let's go from talking about the people at the bottom who need UBI, need a 15 dollar minimum wage to the people at the top. One of the things that I think feels so just honestly bad right now in American life is the fact that one percent of Americans hold more wealth than the bottom 92 percent and the 50 richest people in this country own more than the bottom 165 million people. And that's staggering. So just today, as we're recording this, ProPublica just began releasing the tax secrets, I'm sure you saw it, of the wealthiest people in the country. And, you know, just just to choose one or two data points, Jeff Bezos paid nothing in federal income taxes in 2007 and 2011, Elon Musk in 2018. In other years, it was Michael Bloomberg, George Soros. I'm just curious, what do you think of that report? Do you anticipate that you're going to be a part of it?\nMC: I mean, I think it's very misleading. I think the misleading part of it, there's a difference between income and net worth. If your house escalates in value significantly, you probably didn't do anything to increase the value of your house. It just grew because of the demand in the marketplace, maybe you lived in the right spot. Maybe there was a change in the area you lived in and prices escalated. Based on ProPublica and what they wrote, everybody whose house goes above a certain valuation should pay taxes on that valuation. Now, most people don't have the liquidity to pay those taxes. It's not like paying your property tax at two percent with a threshold limit. And so what ProPublica basically said is because stock valuations went up significantly, not because of anything those companies did, Amazon or any of them, for that matter, those prices in those valuations and even housing prices have gone up significantly because in response to the pandemic and the risk of an economic crash, interest rates went to zero. And when interest rates go to zero, you get appreciable assets appreciating faster and to extreme levels. And so while, you know, the amounts that were published are staggering in so many respects, the data you refer to is correct, and it's also staggering, it's not money in their pocket. It's not like, ‘OK, I can go spend that money.’ They have to sell their shares of stock first, and chances are the minute they sell them, the value of those things go down significantly. That's part one. Part two, when interest rates go up, those valuations, those share valuations are going to go down fast and they're going to go down hard. And if you pay taxes on those, then all of a sudden, OK, are you going to rebate them back? You know, because let's just say, you know, Jeff Bezos stock is valued at a trillion dollars and you tax him at one percent and that one percent of a trillion dollars is ten billion dollars and you force him to write a check for ten billion dollars. Well, now he's got to sell some of that stock. OK, so be it. But then let's say interest rates, because the economy overheats in response, go up to 10 percent and the value of a stock goes from one trillion down to one billion. It's happened before. Now, all of a sudden, he's written the check the previous year or two years ago for 10 billion. Now he's worth a billion, and does the government refund the delta? Since you use valuations based off of just, you know, mark to market pricing? There's all kinds of intricacies. Look. I’m the luckiest motherfucker in the world, right? I have more money than I ever possibly dreamed of. Do I have more money than one person deserves? Probably. Can I make all kinds of excuses for what I'll do with that money? Yeah, but the reality is nobody's entitled to all this. It takes luck to get to that amount of money. And, you know, like I said, I was plenty lucky because the stock market went to extreme highs and I was smart enough to protect it rather than be greedy and think it's going to keep on going up. But the point I was getting to, if I'm worth X billions of dollars, I don't have that in cash. I might have just a small percentage of that in actual cash. And the rest is in investments and companies and entrepreneurs that I've invested in, in programs that I've invested in. And so if now all of a sudden, you know, you're taxing me on my net worth, I'm going to have to sell things. And that may not be bad to 99.98 percent of the population, but it will change the economics of taxation and the valuation of the assets that people have. And so it's a tricky formula. It's difficult to try to find the right solution for that. And so, you know, when Elizabeth Warren talks about wealth tax, it's not that I'm against taxing me more. Right. I paid 29 percent, I think, last year in income taxes and 19 percent the year before. You know, I'm not opposed to paying more in taxes at all. But I think, you know, in terms of regulation, you want to build from the bottom up, because the other thing that we know, no matter how much you take from me, Jeff Bezos or whatever, putting it through the government, by the time it trickles down to people who need it, most of its gone.\nBW: So just to just to put this in the plainest language possible, you're saying that what looks like a great injustice, what generates all of these outrage headlines, they're actually part of just a much more complicated story about how the ultra rich go about managing their massive wealth in our current regulatory system.\nMC: Yeah, I wouldn’t even say how we go about managing our massive wealth. I'm just saying a lot of it's just contextual and circumstantial, right? If there was not a pandemic which caused interest rates to go to actually zero or below, in some cases, you would not have seen those gains. Or if interest rates for any reason remained at three, four or five percent, those gains wouldn't be in existence if interest rates go up to eight, nine, ten percent, those gains disappear. So the numbers that they're pinpointing as being an injustice are very fleeting numbers, they go up because interest rates go down and they go down when interest rates go up. And so taxing them creates other types of problems that create a situation that's not sustainable. And let me add to that again, that just extracting that money from us and again, I'm not against paying more taxes and I've said this many times, is not necessarily going to help anybody at the bottom because the efficiency of the government getting it there trickle-down is very difficult. Trickle up works. Right. Trickle down does not work. And I think the real response should be ‘How can we get appreciable assets into more people's hands?’ Can we regulate so that people who work in companies that go public, you know, there's a ratio between the amount of stock that the CEO is granted or the C suite is granted and the amount of stock that every other employee, you know, from the least paid hourly employee, how much stock do they get so that when interest rates go down, they benefit as well? You know, whatever the percentage of income and again, I've said these things many times. Yes. Whatever the percentage of the income that is assigned in stock allocations to a CEO, that percentage of income in stock allocations should be assigned to the employee earning the least. Because when you give people appreciable assets, as these things evolve in our economy and the global economy, everybody benefits at least proportionately the same. You know, in my companies, everybody that I've ever started, everybody's gotten stock. And every time I've sold a company, they've benefited proportionately. They didn't have as much stock as I did because I took the risk up front or invested my money up front. But all the employees got shares of stock. 300 out of 330 employees of Broadcast.com when we sold it became millionaires, many of them earning ten dollars an hour. And so it's something that I did in practice, and I think it's something that works. It's not about tearing down, it's about building up. And we can't look at the government as being efficient in how they transfer wealth. We've got to find better ways and look at the things that made people like me rich and make those available to people at the lowest pay levels so that they can increase their net worth. And so they don't face the same challenges and risks that your generation is.\nBW: So obviously, you're one of the leads on one of my favorite shows, which is Shark Tank. And I've heard you say that one of your main goals in doing the show is educating people about finance. And I am including myself very much in this as someone in their mid-30s who just got their first real credit card, like the financial literacy in this country is so poor. I would just love to hear you on, quickly because there's so many things I want to get to, what are the top three things that individuals can do for themselves right now when it comes to basic financial literacy and making smart decisions with their money?\nMC: Number one, pay off your credit cards because your credit card company, once you go past 30 days, is going to charge you an obscene amount of interest and you only lose. You can't make that amount of interest fast enough. You can't earn enough income fast enough to pay off those bills. And I know that's easier said than done. Trust me, I've had more than a few credit cards cut up. I've had more than a few days where I won't pick up my phone because of the bill collectors. So I've been there. But you've got to avoid taking on debt that goes past thirty days. That is first and foremost. And then if you are able to save any amount of money, learn about cryptocurrency and in particular something called decentralized finance, because cryptocurrencies are changing the banking game. And just like, you know, if you were to ask me about the future of technology in 1995, I would have told you about the Internet. And now the future of technology and finance is something called decentralized finance. And instead of making point zero two percent on your savings, you can make four or five, eight, 10 percent on your savings. That's what I'm doing with my money, where I have available cash. And I think it's something smart for everybody to learn about.\nBW: What's the third thing?\nMC: You know what I've always tried? There was a book I read called ‘The Best Investment Guide You'll Ever Need’, and this book is 30 years old. And the whole premise of the book is that being a smart shopper is the best way to invest. And so if you're able to buy, you know, toothpaste on sale at 50 percent off at the dollar store, that's a great investment because you're making 50 percent on money you otherwise would be spending on toothpaste. Same with toilet paper. Anything that you can find enough space under your bed. You know, I lived with six guys in a three bedroom apartment and didn't have my own room, all I had was a pile. And I still would like to have my little trash bag full of shit and I put stuff in there that I could buy cheap. And, you know, that's what I recommend to anybody, because whatever you save on a consumable that you use on an ongoing basis, that's real savings. That's real money.\nBW: I want to talk about the idea of fuck you money, because the whole concept, right, is you work your ass off, you make a pile of money, and then you get to say fuck you to people and you get to actually say what you want. In fact, I have seen the actual opposite of that being true in the world. One of the themes of the show is being honest in public about what we really think. I find that the people that have nothing to lose, young people, poor people are most courageous about saying what they really think and that the more fuck you money a person gets, the more they're captured by that money and that the people who tend to be the most double thinking, saying the truth in private and saying something different in public. The people who are most scared to say what they think out loud are the people in the C Suite, they're the people with the most power. I'm wondering if you've noticed that paradox. \nMC: Of course, but only in the social media era, because if you're in a C suite and, you know, by definition you're running a company, you are at the top of a company, and so it's not just about you. You know, the perception of your brand, the perception of your products and services are going to be influenced by what's said on social media. And so, you know, when I first made my biggest money after we sold Broapdcast.com and I was able to get to a point where I was liquid somewhat, then it was different. I could say, fuck you to everybody. And I did. \nBW: Who would you say it to first?\nMC: When I bought the Dallas Mavericks, I mean, the whole NBA. You know, I got fined more than anybody, you know, to this day. And I didn't give a shit what anybody thought. I was just going to do what I thought was right. And, you know, I've done it in business my entire career. With social media changes it now, instead of just saying, fuck you to somebody, I can just tweet something and get my point across knowing that, you know, half the people who respond to that, we are going to say, fuck you right back to me. And so that's really what's changed it more than anything else.\nBW: So this next question I want to ask you is really about the point of having money and the point of having power. And I want to say that this is not a gotcha question. I'm not trying to bait you. And I'm asking this because I admire you and I admire you because honestly, you're authentic and principled and human. And this question is about China, where I have real cognitive dissonance. You're Jewish, as I am and your grandparents immigrated from Russia and Romania, a quarter of your mother's family were murdered by the Nazis. And the stories coming out of China to me feel very similar to what happened under the Nazis, concentration camps, forced labor, forced sterilization, torture, rape and the NBA, and they're not alone, so many other American corporations are the same, are making hundreds of millions of dollars from the Chinese market. And I would argue that the league has made it impossible for anyone associated with the NBA to speak out about these atrocities being committed by the Chinese Communist Party. And the reason for that is obvious. It's because they don't want to lose the market.  \nMC: I’ve come out against what’s happening to the Uyghurs and said it's awful, it's horrible. There's no other way to explain it. There's no justification for it. It's wrong.\nBW: OK, I guess I feel like, you know, when Daryl Morey to choose one example, who was the GM of the Houston Rockets when he tweeted ‘Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong’, and then you have LeBron James saying that he wasn't educated on the situation at hand. You had a moment a few months ago where if you went on NBA dotcom, you couldn't order a jersey that said ‘Free Hong Kong’, but you could order one that said, ‘Fuck America.’ Like we know that there is a tremendous moral hypocrisy happening here, and I fail to understand why this isn't the hill that everyone wants to die on. Why isn't this the battle worth picking? Isn't this exactly what power and money is for?\nMC: There's a lot of different answers for that. But the reality is, you know, the domestic politics effectively of China or any country for that matter, right? Why are we not talking about Myanmar?. Why are we not talking about atrocities in Africa? And I'm not trying to play what-about-ism? But what it comes down to is the unfortunate reality of this world is, you know, there are atrocities across the globe and we can't be the arbiter and we can't be the regulator of all of them, you know, as business people.\nBW: Right. But what we can decide if we're running a Hollywood studio not to edit the movie in order to suit the Chinese Communist Party.\nMC: , I mean, we're not editing anything. With the NBA we sell them content and if anything, you know, we hope that we send messages of who we are and we can influence their culture. And by creating a void, we lose that opportunity. And look, there's no winning answer to this. There's not an answer I can give you that this is the one right way to do it. It's not simple, right? And just like if you go over there and they look at American culture, they'll give you 20 reasons why things we do here are all wrong, and it should be a hill that they die on. \nBW: But you wouldn't draw that kind of... you don't buy that cultural relativism, obviously. \nMC: Meaning?\nBW: You're right that the Chinese Communist Party would say that. But I'm making sure that you're not buying that argument. \nMC: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not saying what they're saying is accurate. Right. What I'm saying is that when it comes to domestic politics of other countries, you know it's very, very difficult for a company organization, even an individual, to take stands on all of them. And look, you know, we put in place, I think, rules in terms of the vendors that we work with and where their products are created. And that's important. And we've done that. You don't want, you know, things coming out of that region, the Xinjiang region, to be sold. And, you know, those are things that we do. But, you know, I haven't taken a stand on other countries' domestic policies, and that's not something I'm going to do.\nBW: But like, you know, the concentration camps in Nazi Germany, someone could make the argument that that was just Germany's domestic policy.\nMC: Yes, they could. Right. And what I'm saying, we're talking about just different business things and try to be as clear as I can, that any of the atrocities that are happening to Uyghurs, or in that region are wrong. And the question then becomes, as a country, what steps do we want to take? Because, do we intervene? I don't know. You know, do you attack China? That's not a question for me to answer.\nBW: You're right, I guess to me, the answer would be to put as much pressure economically, morally, rhetorically, diplomatically as possible, and it feels like we're so far away from that. I mean, the Olympics in 2024 are going to be in Beijing, right?\nMC: Again, there's a lot of ways that you can try to discuss the question, but how do you really affect change? You know, it's like talking about Amazon, right, in some respects. And I'm trying not to compare Amazon to China, but, you know, you're pissing in the wind at certain levels. And I get that if you want to aggregate impact, then it's important, but there's different ways to do it. There's diplomatic ways to do it and there's stronger ways to do it. But we have to come to an agreement as a country to do those things in order for them to have impact and just despairing approaches I don't think really gets anywhere.\nBW: Well, I don't think it's despairing. I think it's saying, you know, if we do nothing, if we accommodate the Chinese Communist Party--as you know, there was an incredible story in the Times a few weeks ago about Apple-- like, if we accommodate them, then lack of change is a foregone conclusion. I guess one last question on China and then I really want to talk to you about crypto. The idea about policy vis-à-vis China, especially when I worked at the Wall Street Journal editorial page, was this idea that by liberalizing economic policy toward China that somehow free people would follow free markets. Right. That inevitably, you know, the trickle down effect of capitalism is something akin to liberal democracy. That's turned out not to be true. And I guess are you surprised by how that has played out? And did you used to believe in that wisdom, too? \nMC: No. \nBW: You’re not surprised. \nMC: Did I hope that it would work?It's just like anything else, you try it and either it works or it doesn't work, right? So did I hope it would work. Yes, of course. But China Inc. being run the way it is basically as a corporation, you know, they know how to compete. They do a better job of planning and they're smarter than communists were in the past. And so we have to recognize that and compete accordingly. And so, you know, we have to recognize that they've got plans for artificial intelligence and they have plans for their economy. They have plans to try to dominate globally. And we as a country have to find ways to compete with that. Otherwise, we'll find the sphere of influences having shifted dramatically. And that's the reality.\nBW: Well, let's talk about the future, because I'm really scared that China's going to own it. And your job, one of your key jobs, I think, is to see the future, to make bets on it. I'm curious about what your big bets are right now. It sounds like obviously, I know cryptocurrency is at the top of that list. What joins crypto?\nMC: Well, let me add the second thing is artificial intelligence, and that's going to drive everything because that has military implications, that has economic implications, that has health care implications. It's the fundamental competitive tool that we need to be better at China than that we need to be the best in the world at, in order to continue to be the strongest country in the world economically and militarily. And I think that's a good thing. And so we need to invest heavily. And I don't think the Trump administration fully understood it. I think the Biden administration is certainly getting their arms around it. But we're still not dealing with it from an educational perspective. And we need many, many more engineers. We need many more AI-literate people. I started the Mark Cuban AI boot camp where we go into underprivileged schools and we put on classes for kids from underprivileged schools to teach them about A.I. and try to get them excited about it. I invested in another company and I'm spacing their name, but all they do is provide advanced physics and other AP classes via Zoom, starting off in Mississippi, into underprivileged communities to try to get kids, you know, as young as twelve excited about learning, you know, science and A.I. and advanced topics like that where otherwise they'd have no access. If we don't improve our education, we're not going to be able to compete. We have two great assets in this country, the intellectual capital of our children, right how smart they are, how smart and driven they want to be and our entrepreneurial mindset. There's no country in the world like the United States that is as entrepreneurial as we are. You know, that's one of the reasons I do Shark Tank. I want people to get excited that there is a way to achieve the American dream, that starting a company is a good thing, that being innovative and creating new opportunities so that you can kick Amazon's ass, you can kick Wal-Mart's ass, you can kick China's ass, those are all good things, but they all start with education; first, middle and last. And so that's how we are going to compete. And to me, those are the things that we really need to to stay ahead on.\nBW: OK, there's so many things I want to ask you about education, but I know that we're tight on time--\nMC: If you keep on going I’ll keep on going for you, Bari.\nBW: Oh, you're so sweet. I want to stick...well, OK, just one question on education like that all sounds amazing. And then I think about the past year and I, I feel like I want to laugh- cry because, you know, the idea of like poor kids in Mississippi learning about A.I. and programing and coding sounds unbelievable. And then you look at the rate of literacy in this country and basic math in this country and the fact that, you know, the teachers’ unions control these schools. And I think that if any group was more beclowned this year, it would be them. And so I guess, you know, the big picture question for me is, is one about school choice and how passionately you feel about that issue?\nMC: I'm not passionate about it one way or another, honestly, it's not something I've really delved into. So it's not that I don't care. It's just that I'm not very literate on it. But I am very passionate about child care and child care support services and preschool and making sure kids don't go hungry, because if they're hungry, they're not going to learn. If they're living in squalor, they're not going to learn. I started the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, first time I ever put my name on a company, and effectively, we're going out, starting with generic drugs, sourcing them and manufacturing them wherever we can and selling them at cost plus 15 percent and being fully transparent and all our costs. And I mention that as it applies to kids, because the first drug that we chose was a drug called albendazole, which is the response for hookworm and all these different worming diseases. And those are prevalent, shockingly enough, still in rural Alabama and rural Texas. And kids get them because they're walking in sewage where they don't have appropriate sewage in their homes or in the Boys and Girls Club, wherever it may be. And so we're providing it for free to them. And, you know, the point is that we need to solve early stage development for kids because by the time they hit five, six, seven years old, if they're hungry and their parents weren't around because of work or didn't have jobs or, you know, have other issues, then we're fucked. And so as important as education is, setting up kids to be ready by the time they reach school to me is just as important. And so that's something that we need to solve. \nBW: Right, it's like how do we compete with China and remain this bastion of entrepreneurship where kids can have garbage bag businesses when the next generation, you know, has hookworm and doesn't know how to read?.\nMC: One hundred percent. And so you can't solve them all at once. Right? You can try, certainly. But again, we need to stop thinking in terms of political dogma, whether it's Republican trickle down or Democratic, their version of trickle down, which is you write the check to the government and it trickles down to the people who need it. Neither one of them works. And we need to start thinking in terms of getting appreciable assets into families hands, as I mentioned earlier, so that as the economy evolves, they get to benefit from them, you know, livable wage, as Bernie Sanders says, you know, so that people can get their kids health, child care, you know, UBI for child care and caretakers, you know, so that parents, a parent can can be at home to properly, you know, spend time with their children, better schools. Those are the things that we need to do. And, you know--\nBW: This sounds like a stump speech. I mean that as a compliment. Like, you are articulating things in a way that... I'm looking at the mayoral race right now in New York and like, you know...  would you ever run?\nMC: No. Hell no. But I would tell you that the reason it works this way is not that Andrew Yang and others don't think about it and aren't literate on it. It's when you have a two party system, everything's going to be fucked up. And when you have a two party system that is built on primaries, you know, where most people don't vote and the people who vote are the most extreme, you know? And that's why, you know, it's interesting. I think one of the big fuckups of the New York mayoral race is they're not talking about rank choice voting at all. And the candidates aren't using it to their advantage that I've seen at all. You don't have to be, you know, the number one candidate initially, you could be the number two or maybe even number three candidate and pull votes from the bottom candidates and end up winning the election. And if we're you know, I wish the media and podcasts would cover RCV because rank choice voting takes out the extremes and the extreme candidate and diminishes the impact of the money that comes from the extremes and that's important, and we can't get to dealing with the real issues like we've been talking about unless we take the extremes out of primary voting.\nBW: So I think everyone can see that we're living in a time of extreme polarization and tribalism. One of the drivers of that is primaries. The other driver of that, I think, is social. And many people, you know, I think rightly blame the algorithm right all the time for fomenting the kind of outrage like it feels like we're in this perpetual outrage cycle. So going back to I, do you think that I can be built in such a way that it gives us less of the things that appeal to our strongest negative emotions?\nMC: Oh, yeah. That's not an AI problem. That's a Facebook problem.  \nBW: You don't think you don't think that's also a Twitter problem?\nMC: Less so. Less so. Right. Because maybe it's more--\nBW: Not in my experience. \nMC: No, it's not that Twitter can't be brutal. Right. I mean, absolutely brutal. I've been, all the worst of the worst of the dregs of the worst have attacked me on Twitter in huge numbers. But it's easier on Twitter just to set your feed so that it's chronological. And, you know, when you set it, so that it's picked by Twitter, you see a lot more of the garbage. If you set it to chronological order, you see a lot less of it. Whereas on Facebook, it's almost impossible just to get a pure feed. And Facebook optimizes for revenue more than Twitter does. And so when Facebook designs its A.I. and they build their models, you know, the fact that they amplify for revenue means you're going to get exposed to far more extremes and you're going to get exposed to things you may not even realize amp you up and make you use the service more. And I truly believe that there should be no Section 230 protections for any amplified post, meaning if something is artificially amplified for any reason, that means Facebook has made the decision to amplify that post via artificial intelligence, you should get no Section 230 protections. If it's just chronological, go for it.\nBW: That's a really sophisticated, nuanced answer. I'm curious what you think about the idea that Clarence Thomas floated in that recent decision about thinking about companies like Facebook as something more like common carriers or public utilities, an idea that's been amplified by people like David Sacks?\nMC: No, they're not. I mean, and that shows the lack of understanding of what's going on with artificial intelligence. They're not common carriers, not even close. You know, Facebook is ripe for disruption. You know, they're not, they've survived, I don't know, 16 years, you know, who knows how long they'll last. But there are issues with scale when you're being protected on posts that are not supposed to be protected if you influence them in any way. Right. If you act as a publisher in any way. And so those protections need to be taken away. And that changes fundamentally what Facebook is able to do.\nBW: There are all kinds of theories and a lot of smart people love to say, you know, if we only fix X, everything would get better. You know, for some people it's racism. For others, it's the media. For others, wealth inequality or wokeness or political polarization. If you, Mark Cuban, very powerful man, could wave a magic wand, a wand maybe that you already have and correct a single problem. Which one would you choose?\nMC: I mean, if I was going that's a long list, obviously. Health care should be at the top of the list. But to give you and there's things that I've worked on with health care and it's such a fucked up mess, but it's fixable. But I don't know that it's fixable in concept. I don't know if it's fixable in execution. And the reason it's not fixable is because of our political system. So if I was going to wave a magic wand, I would disintegrate both political parties and outlaw political parties.\nBW: Interesting, no political parties at all,\nMC: At all, because they no longer serve the purpose they once did, you know, in an era where it was difficult to communicate in communities, political parties had real value. But now we have so many options to create community, to create alliances, to, you know, come together as a group. All political parties have become is a platform for extremism and power. You know? How is it that Democrats always seem to vote monolithically in the House? How is that even possible? And same with Republicans. Now we see Joe Manchin not vote with all the other Democrats, and that's heresy. Then from that, we want to get rid of the filibuster. And it's like, hello, you don't think the Republicans are going to be just as extreme if the filibuster is gone when they get in power? I mean, it's just ridiculous. We have these politicians that leverage their party to amplify their power ss much as Facebook uses A.I. to amplify their posts for revenue, it's just wrong across the board. And it's not like the two parties give us the best candidate. There's an organization that I support called the Center for Competitive Democracy, and we've spent millions of dollars and all we do is work to help independents or small party candidates get on the ballot because the Democrats and Republicans, the one thing they'll work together on is to keep third party and independent candidates off the ballots. And it's not like the candidates that the two main parties propose and put up for us to vote on are typically great candidates and they get chosen because they're the best candidate. So to me, the two parties, you get rid of them, you get rid of parties, then all of a sudden you have people who hopefully get elected because they stand up for things that can help their communities.  \nBW: It's a little like the Imagine song from the Beatles. Like Imagine there's no countries Imagine there's no religion. Imagine there's no political parties. But it's almost like I don't think by outlawing political tribes, you get rid of the tribalism that's in all of us.\nMC: Oh, yeah, no. It changes dramatically because of the money involved, because the one thing parties do is they aggregate money and people and money can create power, particularly in politics. And because so few people participate, and particularly the primary process selects candidates from the extremes, you get rid of parties, you change all the dynamics, and people have to become supportive and hopefully become supportive based off of the idea or the concept or the implementation or the execution of it, you know, as opposed to my team, and that tribalism. We don't we don't need a Democratic team. We don't need a Republican team. We don't need a Green Party team. We need candidates that represent their constituents that will work for their constituents in the country.\nBW: Mark, one of your recent investments is in something called Virtual Humans, Dawg, which I spent a lot of time looking at last night. It is so scary and freaky. And I feel like I'm about to buy all of my clothes based on the advice of a sims. So can you explain to people what virtual humans is?\nMC: It's making the real world partially simulation, I guess, where you can create synthetic people who take on personalities on social media. And because they're not real people, real people connect to them a little bit more easily because there's no consequence. You know, there's no consequence of what's going to happen when you see them in real life and they're, you know, virtualhumans.org is going to create a wide variety of those people and so that people will have people to talk to, you know, synthetic sims to talk to. And you add some chatbots and everything. Think of them as virtual pets, only in the shape of a human.\nBW: Well, in this shape, in the shape of a pin up. I mean, they all look like they're like...\nMC: They're all flawed. Right. They're all meant to have flaws and they're not meant to be some unattainable shape, form or look, they're really meant to be representative. And maybe what we have on this site right now is not fully representative. But the goal is that there's somebody that's going to be something like you and look a little bit like you for everybody. \nBW: But I just look at it and I can't help but think like, oh my God, are we going the way of where no one has sex in real life and they just, like, fall in love with a simulated sex doll on the Internet?\nMC: Yeah, that I don't have an answer to. It's going to be weird, there's no question about it. You combine artificial intelligence, you combine the ability to create the seemingly real characters, and you add that to social media where you can script a lot of it. It’s going to be weird. There's no question about it.\nBW: I know that you are very into NFTs. I have spent a lot of time talking to very smart people who are also into NFTs. I need you to convince me that it's not just a screenshot because I don't understand what this is or why it's a real thing beyond just a fad like Pogs.\nMC: It's just a digital collectible for the most part. Right. There are other business applications, but, you know, whatever it is that they're painting on your wall or that picture on your wall, whatever it is, you like it and you like to look at it. Now, look at your which do you look at more the picture on your wall. Let's say it's not a family picture. Let's just say it's just a painting or a landscape or whatever. Do you look at the things that are on your wall or the pictures on your phone more? Which do you value more? And so with an NFTs, it's just a digital asset that can be collected, traded, bought and sold, that's all.\nBW: And do you think that this is going to be something that lots of us are going to get into? Or is this going to be a rarefied thing for the people that already have a Jeff Koons statue in their backyard?\nMC: No collectibles are collectible. That's up to everybody. Why is a Picasso worth what it's worth? Why do some people like this art versus that art? That's just one one application of NFTs. It's really a proof of concept. But look at textbooks. You know, we're already used to buying digital books on Amazon, right? Many of us read on Kindle and it's no big deal to read online. Some of us prefer physical books. But think in terms of textbooks, what if we made textbooks into NFTs so that, you know, you're a college kid? And instead of trying to find a used book for your class, either in a used bookstore or online for a used book marketplace, it was just an NFT. You could print it out on a printer if you want, maybe even ship it if it gives you access to a physical book, but when your class is over, you just go on to the marketplace and you just sell that NFT for that textbook. You don't have to ship a physical book. You don't have to carry it somewhere. You don't have to grade it to see if pages are missing or anything like that. You just sell it when you're done or you have Cliff Notes for a class, you buy them for ten bucks, you use them during the class. It's an NFT, so when you're done with it, you go to opensea.io marketplace and you sell it. So there's a bunch of applications that will come up with NFTs that will simplify things and be more efficient.\nBW: We are living in the weirdest time.\nMC: OK, there's never a time that's not weird. Never.\nBW: OK, but don't you think this is weirder than most?\nMC: No, no. Let me just tell you, the early days of the Internet were insane and the technology going from analog to digital just freaked people out. The early days of the PC business, you know, where people thought they were all going to lose their jobs because a PC would take their place. The bookkeeper's spreadsheets. It always happens, Bari, and it always feels weird. Always. Twenty five years from now, you're going to look back at this and go, oh, my God, that was nothing, because A, B and C happened. That's just the way shit works. It makes it interesting. That's fucking life, you know, shit's fucked up, you know, in a lot of different ways. And we just try to do our best to minimize how it's fucked up and, you know, try to help ourselves, help our families and help other people.\nBW: So take us back to the South Hills to end it here. What are the values that you learned in our hometown that have taken you from there to where you are now?\nMC: Yeah, the same values. I mean, my friends or my from back then, you know, the kids I worked at camp with Jerry and Todd and Stu, etc., you know, we learned hard work is good. You know, you can benefit from your own effort. And we learn to be nice that when you're nice to people, things work better and you can really have an impact. It may just be locally, but, you can have an impact on others if you're just nice. And I think that that's the greatest lesson.

They feel that we should be thanking them for all that they have done for us. They are confused, and so are we. We keep forgetting that directly talking about race is a waste of our breath. We are asking a demented, violent predator who thinks that they are a saint or a superhero, to accept responsibility. It ain&#8217;t gonna happen. They have five holes in their brain.

I left academic institutions because of institutional racism. Word.&#8221; Tell me about that. What happened?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>AK: I trained at Cornell and Columbia and NYU and I really experienced all aspects of Cornell and Columbia as very racist. Less so NYU. NYU I found to be a lot more open. Cornell, I think we had one black faculty member. When I was at Columbia we had, I think, one black psychoanalyst. And just the way of thinking was all the same.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have examples of what you experienced?</strong></p><p>Sure. When I was at Cornell, I got beat up by a patient&#8217;s family member. I have a friend who is blonde and when she got threatened [by a patient] I think they did a Grand Rounds or a talk or some kind of symposium. They really addressed it. She was given a lot of support. And I&#8217;m not even sure if she was actually hit or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, when that happened to me, and I actually got beat up, the way they responded was, &#8220;Well what do you think you did to elicit this?&#8221; That's the question I got. Like I must have done something to provoke the attack.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did you file a complaint?</strong></p><p>No, because the more that you push back, the more they are going to keep attacking you. Also, in my first year, along with another person of color, I had the most <a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/on-call\">Saturday call</a>. These things are not incidental. There was a meeting where they actually tried to take away my vacation from me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why?</strong></p><p>They came up with this idea that since I hadn&#8217;t put the request on the calendar then they&#8217;re not going to give it to me. So that one I did push back on. That one I reported. It was a very chilling conversation that I had with somebody. This is how these chilling conversations go. It&#8217;s never through email. They&#8217;ll call you on the phone and say, &#8220;We need to talk to you about something,&#8221; because they never want any of this stuff documented. They&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Since you didn&#8217;t put this on the calendar, you&#8217;re not allowed to have vacation.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;So-and-so and so-and-so didn't put it on the calendar. Why do they get vacation?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Do you really want to put yourself in the position where you're pointing out your colleagues&#8217; stuff?&#8221; Like they needed to make me the person who is calling out my colleagues &#8212; not that it was unfair.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When was this?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>When I was in residency. Either 2007 or &#8216;08.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Clearly the national conversation has changed a lot. I think in 2007, 2008, there were probably very few people who knew what anti-racism was. There was a lot more ignorance on the part of white people. Do you think things have changed in any meaningful way?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In some places things are starting to change, in other places, they really can&#8217;t reflect on themselves because there&#8217;s a lot to lose. I have a question for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sure.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Is what you're writing going to be from a conservative perspective?</p><p><strong>Well, I&#8217;m not conservative so, no.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I ask because I actually think that conservatives are psychologically healthier.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Interesting.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>They are more in touch with their anger and negative feelings. They can articulate it. They can say it, they&#8217;re not covering it up or like &#8220;Oh my god, I&#8217;m amazing, I love all people.&#8221; There's not all this liberal fluff of goodness. Conservatives can go there. They can say things that are uncomfortable that I think liberals would shirk at or move away from or deny.&nbsp;</p><p>I would feel more comfortable hanging out with Ann Coulter than a lot of liberals because she&#8217;s unlikely to do anything. She&#8217;s in contact with her anger and her hatred, and I think that needs to be worked through, don't get me wrong, for the country to heal, but she's actually in contact with those feelings that a lot of people can't say out loud and that's a safer space. Now do I agree with her? No. But liberals have no access to that at all. The thought is forbidden.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It sounds like what you're saying is that you think liberals would be healthier if they expressed racism.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Absolutely. Well, not <em>racism</em>, because racism is an action. Racism occurs in a couple situations: when you are unaware of aspects of your unconscious, then it will come out in the form of an action. So if you are not aware of your own hatred and rage, it&#8217;s going to come out in an action if the feeling is not metabolized. For people who can say that they hate something and work through that feeling, then there&#8217;s more hope there. That&#8217;s where the work really needs to happen. I can&#8217;t really help the liberal who says, &#8220;There&#8217;s no problem here.&#8221; I can't do that much with that person. This country doesn't really give white people the tools to deal with their negative feelings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I know you have a background in critical theory. How did you go from academia to psychiatry?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>My masters is in humanities and the focus is largely on critical theory. I don't know if you&#8217;re familiar with the University of Chicago, but it was very critical theory-heavy when I went. I did pre-med stuff in undergrad and had always been thinking of these issues. I also majored in English Lit and wondered about other ways of thinking. And I was interested in the unconscious for a long time, so it wasn't that big of a jump for me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>From my experience, therapists tend to act pretty neutral. Is your practice like that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Not at all. I think that's a part of the racist aspect of psychoanalysis, this idea that people are neutral is, I think, a complete fiction. But I would say that who I am inside the room is exactly who I am outside the room. My patients have a pretty good sense of who I am. I&#8217;m not the stereotype of the psychoanalyst where I&#8217;m withholding or won&#8217;t say anything or will just be there as a sounding board because that sounds really fucking cold and empty. That sounds awful. I do have people sit with their emotions and get into unconscious stuff but I&#8217;m there as myself to be with them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Talk to me about the unconscious. What is this?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Critical theory is about how you are positioned in the world. Ever since I was a little kid, since I&#8217;ve interacted with people who are white, and especially white women, I would notice that things were really off. So what I&#8217;ve done by going through psychoanalytic training, which is all about getting in touch with the unconscious, is literally work backwards. I'm like, &#8220;Ok, I&#8217;ve noticed that white people tend to put me in certain roles. White women will experience me this way, white men will experience me this way.&#8221; I'm going to use psychoanalysis to work backwards and treat all of this as a projection to see what I can learn about their mind.</p><p><strong>What do your sessions look like?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I don&#8217;t do CBT [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy], I don&#8217;t do DBT [Dialectical Behavioral Therapy], I don&#8217;t do med management, except like once every three months. I only do intensive psychotherapy or intensive psychoanalysis with or without meds. I largely work with the unconscious. What does it look like? It's different for everybody, but the way people organize their anxiety is usually very meaningful. And the narrative they tell me about it is how they are uniquely suffering. I feel like it's my job to help them with that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think that it&#8217;s your mission or your job or your duty to get to the root of a white person's racism or deal with their whiteness?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No. That makes it seem like it&#8217;s for me. If I were to do that it would be selfish as fuck. Do I focus on ways I think race is seeped into everything, yes, but it&#8217;s not for me. I can actually see how white people are suffering in a way that is very unique and different from people of color.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the difference between white peoples' suffering and the suffering of people of color?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People of color, myself included, suffer from being positioned in the world, psychologically, and the stuff that goes with it: violence, this, that. Now, white people suffer from problems of their own mind. They suffer with trust, they suffer with intimacy, they suffer with closeness, shame, guilt, anxiety. They suffer with their minds. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, people of color are also neurotic and have their own stuff and ups and downs. But there is a fundamental issue I think that is very unique to white suffering and I think that&#8217;s their own mind.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What would you say is the cause of this?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think it&#8217;s colonialism. That history. If you do this much lying to yourself it's going to have an effect on your mind. There's no way it can&#8217;t.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does that work? Are you talking about some kind of epigenetics or the passing down of the collective unconscious? I&#8217;m an American, a white woman, I don't have any direct experience with colonialism although I&#8217;m sure I've benefited from it in some ways, but it&#8217;s hard to see how I would be traumatized by this thing that happened before I was born.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I don&#8217;t think you do feel traumatized. White people experience this as normal. That&#8217;s their level of functioning that feels normal but it&#8217;s picked up in everything. It&#8217;s picked up in history, it's picked up in all aspects of culture.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Could you give me an example?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Of what?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Of how this is picked up in all aspects of culture. How do you see the after-effects of colonialism manifesting itself in the white mind today?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s going to be hard for me to give you a one sentence soundbite on this but I would say, a high level of guilt. I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this before. Other than in white people not eating bread, an incredible level of shame. Feeling really exposed all the time. A lot of perfectionistic tendencies. Not letting themselves move forward. Experiencing themselves as passive a lot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So you think this is the effect of history?</strong></p><p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an effect of history, I think it&#8217;s the effect of telling the lie. If you commit these acts, I don&#8217;t think someone is going to bitch slap you in the future. What got passed along were these lies about what actually happened. And those lies are internalized and become part of the culture.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What lie specifically are you talking about?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One lie would be that any time white people say they discovered something. Any time they steal something they use the word &#8220;discovery.&#8221;</p><p><strong>You mean like food? Culture?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This country. That&#8217;s part of the rhetoric &#8212; &#8220;We discovered a country.&#8221; You haven&#8217;t discovered shit! But this idea is everywhere. Look at food bloggers who are like, &#8220;I invented something new,&#8221; and you're like, &#8220;Oh so you added flaky salt. You added a twig of parsley.&#8221; Everything else is stolen.</p><p><strong>It does seem like you generalize a lot about white people but also people of color. Why do you do that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>What do you feel is a generalization?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Like white people having a high level of guilt or not eating bread. That&#8217;s true for some people, for sure. But I eat bread.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You asked me before, what is the unconscious? I think the unconscious is coming out right now between you and I. This idea that I&#8217;m the one that's generalizing is, I think, a defensive reaction to my talking about whiteness. You feel put on the spot and so I'm the one that's generalizing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So you don&#8217;t think that you are generalizing?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This idea that I&#8217;m the one generalizing is actually defensive. Do I really believe on some level that every single white person is racist? No. Clearly. I have one percent left of that friend group. [In the lecture, Dr. Khilanani explains she has cut most of her white friends out of her life.] So no, I don&#8217;t. At the same time, I'm saying how it functions psychologically when someone says &#8220;You can&#8217;t say that,&#8221; and &#8220;Not all of us,&#8221; what you&#8217;re saying subconsciously is &#8220;I&#8217;m the exception to what you just said and you made me feel like I'm a racist and I don't experience myself that way. I do not want to experience myself as a racist and I'm going to turn the tables on you and say you're the racist because you're generalizing and that&#8217;s what a racist does.\"</p><p><strong>Let's talk about your practice. You've mentioned that you treat a lot of white people and you treat &#8220;whiteness.&#8221; What is the distinction between the two?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I wouldn&#8217;t say there is a distinction. For example, for white women, I do help a lot with passive-aggressiveness &#8212; not being able to use their voice, say things, feeling like there will be a negative consequence. White people have an intense level of guilt. I have never seen a level of guilt that I see among white people. I mean, white people don't eat bread. Think about that. There have been wars all over the world over grains and bread and only here, white people are depriving themselves. Think about that shit. Everyone has this gluten allergy and you're like, what the fuck is a gluten allergy? That's a psychosomatic symptom. If you actually talk to a GI doctor, they're going to say, &#8220;Well, there&#8217;s Celiac and there's everything else&#8221; with a wink, and you know what the &#8220;everything else&#8221; is. It&#8217;s all the guilty gluten people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sure. There are lots of white people who don't eat bread, although I am not one of them. I exclusively eat bread, and I&#8217;m also skeptical of some claims of gluten intolerance but my assumption has always been that they&#8217;re just buying into pseudoscientific B.S. and following health trends. You think it&#8217;s white guilt?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>On an emotional level, absolutely. Like, if I raise an eyebrow at a white person around bread, the first response is like, &#8220;It&#8217;s real.&#8221; What does that mean? They mean it&#8217;s not psychological.</p><p><strong>Right. It&#8217;s a medical issue, not a mental one.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I don&#8217;t deny that people may get symptoms, but how is it that all these people suddenly now, after all the violence has occurred, are not eating bread. It&#8217;s like the weirdest fucking thing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But what does bread have to do with violence? What&#8217;s the connection there?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think the bread is about guilt and needing to keep them in a state of deprivation and stay guilty.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you think white people should feel guilty?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No, I think guilt is the most useless emotion on the planet. What function does it serve? It's not helpful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let's talk about your talk, &#8220;The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind.&#8221; How did you get invited to do Grand Rounds at Yale in the first place?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I was invited to do it. A big part of my practice is also doing consultations for marginalized people and how they've been harmed in treatments, usually psychiatric or psychological treatments.</p><p><strong>Ok so the talk was in April, and it was public?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Yes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So walk me through what happened. You get invited, you give them the title of the talk, and then what?</strong></p><p>Nothing. There was not a response for a long period of time. I was kind of surprised because usually people want to know a lot of details. And then I think, and I&#8217;m not sure about this, maybe they only put the announcement out the day before.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So not a lot of notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m not sure. This is what I think because I only got the concerns as relayed to me from the dean right before. I didn&#8217;t hear any concerns prior to that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let me pull up the email you forwarded me from the dean real quick. The message is from someone in the department to the dean and it says: &#8220;Good morning, I was surprised to see the announcement for tomorrow&#8217;s grand rounds. I imagine replacing the words &#8216;white mind&#8217; with &#8216;Asian mind&#8217; or &#8216;gay mind&#8217; as we work towards equity and inclusion and unity. I wonder what impact this presentation will have.&#8221; Let's just address that. &#8220;Imagine replacing the words &#8216;white mind&#8217; with &#8216;Asian mind&#8217; or &#8216;gay mind&#8217; as we work towards equity and inclusion and unity.&#8221; What&#8217;s your response to this? Does this person have a point?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think part of the anxiety is my using the word &#8220;white&#8221; and them having to reflect on that. And there was the use of the word &#8220;equity.&#8221; When I&#8217;m breaking this down psychologically, what they&#8217;re saying on some level is like, &#8220;We need things to be the same. If you can say &#8216;white,&#8217; we can say &#8216;Asian.&#8217;&#8221; Psychologically, they&#8217;re actually making a false equivalence. What they&#8217;re doing psychologically is obliterating the difference between white and Asian, and if you obliterate the difference there&#8217;s no fucking problem here so shut up, you're the real racist. That&#8217;s how it functions psychologically.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let&#8217;s go through a bit of your talk here. You write: &#8220;This is the cost of talking to white people at all. The cost of your own life, as they suck you dry. There are no good apples out there. White people make my blood boil. Around five years ago, I took some actions. I systematically white-ghosted most of my white friends. And got rid of the couple white BIPOCs that snuck in my crew too. I&nbsp; stopped watching the news. Once I started, I couldn&#8217;t stop. I have less than one percent left.&nbsp; It was also a public service. I had fantasies of unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way, burying their body, and wiping my bloody hands as I walked away relatively guiltless with a bounce in my step. Like I did the world a fucking favor.&#8221; I can imagine that for some people the response to hearing a respected professional like yourself say that white people suck you dry and there are no good apples is going to be shame.</strong></p><p>I think what a lot of people felt wasn&#8217;t shame but horror that I was in touch with aggressive feelings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sure. That makes sense. Do you find that this sort of rhetoric is effective or do people reject what you're saying because it is violent?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Before I gave the talk, I said, I want you to observe your thoughts and feelings as I talk. I said, there's a difference between a thought, a fantasy, and an action. Now, my reflection on my own rage was actually that I was feeling impotent. So that's where I was going with that. And kind of normalizing feelings of hatred. This is stuff that exists and I need to dive deep within myself to reflect on how it is that I got here. So there is a reality here, like did I actually cut white people out of my life? Absolutely.</p><p><strong>When you were going through this process of cutting white people out of your life, what specifically would lead you to that decision?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Having the same conversations with people on repeat. People getting defensive, needing to argue, being unable to take in what I&#8217;m saying. An ability to say they&#8217;re not racist. And on repeat. I think my favorite responses were, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re really sensitive. You&#8217;re over-reacting.&#8221; Focusing on my feelings. White women will often tell me that I&#8217;m really edgy and I&#8217;m like, &#8220;That&#8217;s so interesting that you're focused on my edginess. Have you reflected on why they might be?&#8221; But they can&#8217;t go there.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This reminds me a bit of Robin D&#8217;Angelo's writings, where she talks about how often in her trainings, the response from white women in particular is being defensive and shutting down. She calls this &#8220;white fragility,&#8221; but I'm curious about the effect. Do you find this is effective?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It depends on who my audience is. Do I think that that is effective for someone who is not in a place where they think there&#8217;s a problem with them? No, I don&#8217;t. Do I think it's effective for people who are a little bit scared but also kind of curious? Yeah, I do. I know my audience and what my own limits are. I&#8217;m for the people who want to walk into the other room and see how we view you. That&#8217;s who my audience is. In a private practice setting, no, I don&#8217;t do that and that&#8217;s because it's a fucking asshole thing to do. I need to be where they are at. When I&#8217;m speaking publicly, I need to invite someone into my room. This is how I talk with other people of color, this is how I talk with my black friends, this is how I talk with my Asian friends. This is how we talk about you. When I have patients, it's the other way around. I need to be humble and be where they're at. I need to sit with them and understand what they are going through. I feel like I've deepened a lot of my empathy for how much white people suffer from my white patients.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let&#8217;s go through some other sections of the talk.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Did you have any reaction to it?</p><p><strong>I found parts of it difficult to hear, for sure. I also found it refreshingly honest. There was one part that I really liked. You say: &#8220;White people </strong><em><strong>love</strong></em><strong> talking about race right now. You cannot get them to shut the fuck up. It makes them feel good. And, they also imagine it makes us feel good to see their true enlightenment. Talking&nbsp; about racism is a form of self-congratulatory masturbation. White people exchange pleasantries,&nbsp; without really addressing racism. It serves no purpose in connecting other than to jerk themselves off.&#8221;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>I&#8217;m surrounded by people who do that, especially on social media. I find it very performative and it seems disingenuous. It also just seemed to appear overnight after the death of George Floyd. It's like every one I know decided to be an anti-racist the next day. They might not have known what that meant but they bought &#8220;White Fragility&#8221; and Ibram Kendi and maybe read them or maybe just posted photos of them on social media. It felt very performative and self-congratulatory and trendy to me. But I am curious about what you see is the solution here, because you say that white people love talking about race but in another part, you say that talking with white people about race is a &#8220;waste of our breath.&#8221; You say, &#8220;We are asking a demented, violent predator who thinks they are a saint or a superhero, to accept responsibility. They have five holes in their brain. It&#8217;s not going to happen. It&#8217;s like banging your head against a brick wall. Not a good idea.&#8221; But you do talk to white people about race. You were doing it at Yale. Walk me through that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m saying that talking about race right now like white people are doing, like occupying that much space for something they&#8217;ve never actually gone through but see themselves as self-appointed experts as, it serves a defensive function to not feel a negative feeling because if you're teaching about it and you're able to give and help, you don&#8217;t actually have to do the thing that is harder, which is feel negative feelings. So when I was saying that talking to white people is useless, I'm not actually really saying it's useless because if I really thought it was useless I wouldn't devote time to doing this. I'm talking about an experience that I have, that people of color have, of futility when coming up against a psychological defense. So it&#8217;s an experience of futility.</p><p><strong>So do you think white people who talk about racism all the time, and I think we could probably picture the stereotype of how that might be, do you think that they're easier to reach because at least they acknowledge the existence of racism?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>No, I think they&#8217;re harder to reach. Their defenses are up, right? You have to be very arrogant to imagine that you're suddenly a teacher of something you're never gone through. That is an incredible level of arrogance. Your psychological defenses are high, they&#8217;re intact, they&#8217;re rigid. So that is actually harder. People are feeling very upset right now that what they thought they were going to have &#8212; a job, a position &#8212; is suddenly now being threatened by people of color. Now actually talking about that and saying that out loud is healthier because they can say it. They're like. &#8220;I&#8217;m mad. I thought that I should be able to get this thing and now I feel like it's been taken away from me.&#8221; That&#8217;s a lot of people&#8217;s experience right now. Suddenly they feel like what should be rightfully theirs has been taken away. But actually what's happening is that the playing field is being leveled and they have to go through a loss as they lose their unearned advantage. That&#8217;s hard. But if someone doesn't have access to that feeling and can't get mad or feel pissed off because they don't think that exists, that&#8217;s harder. That's going to be harder for them emotionally. They&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;It&#8217;s fine, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; How could you be fine? Your entire world operated one way and suddenly what you thought was certain and what you thought was going to be yours, you are no longer sure is going to be coming your way. That's scary.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When you talk about it like that it does seem like you think that white people are going to have to give something up for equity. Do you think that's true and if so what is that thing that white people are going to have to give up?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s not a thing. It&#8217;s a way of being. It's a level of certainty and control that just kind of came for them before.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are you talking about jobs or money or . . . ?</strong></p><p>Yeah, a lot of things. But I also think there's a loss they have to go through that is psychological, too, and this might be the harder thing. If you know one way of existing and that's been your way of existing and suddenly that feels like it&#8217;s changing on you, that&#8217;s terrifying.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A lot of people say that the election of Donald Trump was a reaction to this, but then Donld Trump had a higher share of black and Latino votes in 2020. How do you explain something like that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s internalized whiteness. After a period of time, you're going to start internalizing these things because you're attacked.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You say in your talk, &#8220;I got rid of the couple white BIPOCs that snuck in my crew too.&#8221; What is a white BIPOC?</strong></p><p>It's someone who has internalized a lot of these thoughts. It's the same thing.</p><p><strong>The way that you talk about whiteness, it&#8217;s almost like it&#8217;s a state of being. Is that correct?</strong></p><p>I would say it&#8217;s a state of mind that affects how you think consciously and how you think unconsciously.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are all white people afflicted by whiteness?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s impossible to not be. You would have to do an incredible level of work to not be.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It sounded like your talk was very well received by the audience. But what happened afterwards?</strong></p><p>There were a lot of delays before Yale posted it. They said they were going to put out the talk the following Monday and that they had received a ton of requests for this talk so they wanted to get it up quickly. And then it didn&#8217;t happen. People started emailing them requesting the talk and they got very different responses. First they were saying that there were some technical difficulties and then they told another person that this was a chronic issue and that there are many other talks that need to be released and they need to go in order. That was brand new. Like, if you&#8217;ve been working on this for six weeks, why not say that before? &#8220;It&#8217;s white amnesia, I just suddenly remembered that we are having this IT difficulty. Whoops!&#8221; Then I begin to hear from different people that there is this stuff going on at Yale about the talk, that there&#8217;s pressure building, that a lot of the people wanted to know what was going on, so people started to complain internally and demand that the video be put up. Then they released it internally only. Of course they didn&#8217;t call me during any of this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When we were corresponding via email you said people were afraid. What are they afraid of?</strong></p><p>I guess it would be retaliation. It's sort of like that question you asked me about racism when I was in residency, and it's like this stuff happens to me every minute of every day. They get very angry if you start to stick up for yourself. It really elicits a lot of rage and a lot of retaliation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And this was people trying to get access to the video, they were afraid to ask for it?</strong></p><p>I think people were afraid to put their names on things, that kinda thing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that you say that because I&#8217;ve been interviewing clinicians for this series who are opposed to social justice ideology in medicine and who see the need for progress but who don't like what&#8217;s going on. And nobody will put their name on anything. A lot of people talk about how cancel culture is stifling discourse and people are afraid of consequences, so it&#8217;s interesting to me that we&#8217;re talking about two different groups of people and these people who aren&#8217;t woke are afraid and you&#8217;re saying that the people who are woke are afraid, too. What does that tell you about the moment that we&#8217;re living in right now?</strong></p><p>That everyone is scared to change, I think. People of color are scared of retaliation and consequences for speaking and owning their own thoughts. It&#8217;s a responsibility issue, too. If you are opposed to social justice, why wouldn&#8217;t you say that?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Because they&#8217;re afraid. They all say the same thing, they think they&#8217;ll be penalized if it's known that they oppose antiracism.

But looking at the doctor’s social media, it seems completely genuine.\nHere are some of the quotes from the lecture:\n\nThis is the cost of talking to white people at all. The cost of your own life, as they suck you dry. There are no good apples out there. White people make my blood boil. (Time stamp: 6:45)\n\n\nI had fantasies of unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way, burying their body, and wiping my bloody hands as I walked away relatively guiltless with a bounce in my step. Like I did the world a fucking favor.  (Time stamp: 7:17)\n\n\nWhite people are out of their minds and they have been for a long time.  (Time stamp: 17:06)\n\n\nWe are now in a psychological predicament, because white people feel that we are bullying them when we bring up race. They feel that we should be thanking them for all that they have done for us. They are confused, and so are we. We keep forgetting that directly talking about race is a waste of our breath. We are asking a demented, violent predator who thinks that they are a saint or a superhero, to accept responsibility. It ain’t gonna happen. They have five holes in their brain. It’s like banging your head against a brick wall. It’s just like sort of not a good idea. (Time stamp 17:13)\n\n\nWe need to remember that directly talking about race to white people is useless, because they are at the wrong level of conversation. Addressing racism assumes that white people can see and process what we are talking about. They can’t. That’s why they sound demented. They don’t even know they have a mask on. White people think it’s their actual face. We need to get to know the mask. (Time stamp 17:54)\n\nHere’s the poster from the event. Among the “learning objectives” listed is: “understand how white people are psychologically dependent on black rage.”\n\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-1312-1018 {\n            padding-bottom: 128.88015717092338%;\n            padding-bottom: min(128.88015717092338%, 1312px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-1312-1018 img {\n            max-width: 1018px;\n            max-height: 1312px;\n          }\n        \nWe’ve uploaded the lecture so you can listen to the whole thing yourself. Apologies for the less-than-stellar audio quality.\nThe talk, which was delivered via video in early April, was open to the public. But after it was delivered, Yale made the tape available only to those with a school ID. It was posted along with a trigger warning for “profanity and imagery for violence.” \nKatie Herzog, who wrote yesterday about the spread of wokeness in medicine, interviewed the psychiatrist who delivered the talk, Dr. Aruna Khilanani.  \n\n\nBefore you read on . . .\nWe are working hard to tell the stories others are ignoring.\nIf you value what you read in this newsletter, please become a paid subscriber:\nSubscribe now\n\n\nKH: Your bio online says you are a “Forensic Psychiatrist and Psychoanalyst, with expertise in violence, racism, and marginalized identities. I left academic institutions because of institutional racism. Word.” Tell me about that. What happened? \nAK: I trained at Cornell and Columbia and NYU and I really experienced all aspects of Cornell and Columbia as very racist. Less so NYU. NYU I found to be a lot more open. Cornell, I think we had one black faculty member. When I was at Columbia we had, I think, one black psychoanalyst. And just the way of thinking was all the same. \nDo you have examples of what you experienced?\nSure. When I was at Cornell, I got beat up by a patient’s family member. I have a friend who is blonde and when she got threatened [by a patient] I think they did a Grand Rounds or a talk or some kind of symposium. They really addressed it. She was given a lot of support. And I’m not even sure if she was actually hit or not. \nNow, when that happened to me, and I actually got beat up, the way they responded was, “Well what do you think you did to elicit this?” That's the question I got. Like I must have done something to provoke the attack. \nDid you file a complaint?\nNo, because the more that you push back, the more they are going to keep attacking you. Also, in my first year, along with another person of color, I had the most Saturday call. These things are not incidental. There was a meeting where they actually tried to take away my vacation from me. \nWhy?\nThey came up with this idea that since I hadn’t put the request on the calendar then they’re not going to give it to me. So that one I did push back on. That one I reported. It was a very chilling conversation that I had with somebody. This is how these chilling conversations go. It’s never through email. They’ll call you on the phone and say, “We need to talk to you about something,” because they never want any of this stuff documented. They’ll be like, “Since you didn’t put this on the calendar, you’re not allowed to have vacation.” And I said, “So-and-so and so-and-so didn't put it on the calendar. Why do they get vacation?” And they’re like, “Do you really want to put yourself in the position where you're pointing out your colleagues’ stuff?” Like they needed to make me the person who is calling out my colleagues — not that it was unfair. \nWhen was this? \nWhen I was in residency. Either 2007 or ‘08. \nClearly the national conversation has changed a lot. I think in 2007, 2008, there were probably very few people who knew what anti-racism was. There was a lot more ignorance on the part of white people. Do you think things have changed in any meaningful way? \nIn some places things are starting to change, in other places, they really can’t reflect on themselves because there’s a lot to lose. I have a question for you. \nSure. \nIs what you're writing going to be from a conservative perspective?\nWell, I’m not conservative so, no.   \nI ask because I actually think that conservatives are psychologically healthier. \nInteresting. \nThey are more in touch with their anger and negative feelings. They can articulate it. They can say it, they’re not covering it up or like “Oh my god, I’m amazing, I love all people.” There's not all this liberal fluff of goodness. Conservatives can go there. They can say things that are uncomfortable that I think liberals would shirk at or move away from or deny. \nI would feel more comfortable hanging out with Ann Coulter than a lot of liberals because she’s unlikely to do anything. She’s in contact with her anger and her hatred, and I think that needs to be worked through, don't get me wrong, for the country to heal, but she's actually in contact with those feelings that a lot of people can't say out loud and that's a safer space. Now do I agree with her? No. But liberals have no access to that at all. The thought is forbidden. \nIt sounds like what you're saying is that you think liberals would be healthier if they expressed racism. \nAbsolutely. Well, not racism, because racism is an action. Racism occurs in a couple situations: when you are unaware of aspects of your unconscious, then it will come out in the form of an action. So if you are not aware of your own hatred and rage, it’s going to come out in an action if the feeling is not metabolized. For people who can say that they hate something and work through that feeling, then there’s more hope there. That’s where the work really needs to happen. I can’t really help the liberal who says, “There’s no problem here.” I can't do that much with that person. This country doesn't really give white people the tools to deal with their negative feelings. \nI know you have a background in critical theory. How did you go from academia to psychiatry? \nMy masters is in humanities and the focus is largely on critical theory. I don't know if you’re familiar with the University of Chicago, but it was very critical theory-heavy when I went. I did pre-med stuff in undergrad and had always been thinking of these issues. I also majored in English Lit and wondered about other ways of thinking. And I was interested in the unconscious for a long time, so it wasn't that big of a jump for me. \nFrom my experience, therapists tend to act pretty neutral. Is your practice like that? \nNot at all. I think that's a part of the racist aspect of psychoanalysis, this idea that people are neutral is, I think, a complete fiction. But I would say that who I am inside the room is exactly who I am outside the room. My patients have a pretty good sense of who I am. I’m not the stereotype of the psychoanalyst where I’m withholding or won’t say anything or will just be there as a sounding board because that sounds really fucking cold and empty. That sounds awful. I do have people sit with their emotions and get into unconscious stuff but I’m there as myself to be with them. \nTalk to me about the unconscious. What is this? \nCritical theory is about how you are positioned in the world. Ever since I was a little kid, since I’ve interacted with people who are white, and especially white women, I would notice that things were really off. So what I’ve done by going through psychoanalytic training, which is all about getting in touch with the unconscious, is literally work backwards. I'm like, “Ok, I’ve noticed that white people tend to put me in certain roles. White women will experience me this way, white men will experience me this way.” I'm going to use psychoanalysis to work backwards and treat all of this as a projection to see what I can learn about their mind.\nWhat do your sessions look like? \nI don’t do CBT [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy], I don’t do DBT [Dialectical Behavioral Therapy], I don’t do med management, except like once every three months. I only do intensive psychotherapy or intensive psychoanalysis with or without meds. I largely work with the unconscious. What does it look like? It's different for everybody, but the way people organize their anxiety is usually very meaningful. And the narrative they tell me about it is how they are uniquely suffering. I feel like it's my job to help them with that. \nDo you think that it’s your mission or your job or your duty to get to the root of a white person's racism or deal with their whiteness? \nNo. That makes it seem like it’s for me. If I were to do that it would be selfish as fuck. Do I focus on ways I think race is seeped into everything, yes, but it’s not for me. I can actually see how white people are suffering in a way that is very unique and different from people of color. \nWhat is the difference between white peoples' suffering and the suffering of people of color? \nPeople of color, myself included, suffer from being positioned in the world, psychologically, and the stuff that goes with it: violence, this, that. Now, white people suffer from problems of their own mind. They suffer with trust, they suffer with intimacy, they suffer with closeness, shame, guilt, anxiety. They suffer with their minds. Don’t get me wrong, people of color are also neurotic and have their own stuff and ups and downs. But there is a fundamental issue I think that is very unique to white suffering and I think that’s their own mind. \nWhat would you say is the cause of this? \nI think it’s colonialism. That history. If you do this much lying to yourself it's going to have an effect on your mind. There's no way it can’t. \nHow does that work? Are you talking about some kind of epigenetics or the passing down of the collective unconscious? I’m an American, a white woman, I don't have any direct experience with colonialism although I’m sure I've benefited from it in some ways, but it’s hard to see how I would be traumatized by this thing that happened before I was born. \nI don’t think you do feel traumatized. White people experience this as normal. That’s their level of functioning that feels normal but it’s picked up in everything. It’s picked up in history, it's picked up in all aspects of culture. \nCould you give me an example? \nOf what? \nOf how this is picked up in all aspects of culture. How do you see the after-effects of colonialism manifesting itself in the white mind today? \nIt’s going to be hard for me to give you a one sentence soundbite on this but I would say, a high level of guilt. I’ve never seen anything like this before. Other than in white people not eating bread, an incredible level of shame. Feeling really exposed all the time. A lot of perfectionistic tendencies. Not letting themselves move forward. Experiencing themselves as passive a lot. \nSo you think this is the effect of history?\nI don’t think it’s an effect of history, I think it’s the effect of telling the lie. If you commit these acts, I don’t think someone is going to bitch slap you in the future. What got passed along were these lies about what actually happened. And those lies are internalized and become part of the culture. \nWhat lie specifically are you talking about? \nOne lie would be that any time white people say they discovered something. Any time they steal something they use the word “discovery.”\nYou mean like food? Culture? \nThis country. That’s part of the rhetoric — “We discovered a country.” You haven’t discovered shit! But this idea is everywhere. Look at food bloggers who are like, “I invented something new,” and you're like, “Oh so you added flaky salt. You added a twig of parsley.” Everything else is stolen.\nIt does seem like you generalize a lot about white people but also people of color. Why do you do that? \nWhat do you feel is a generalization? \nLike white people having a high level of guilt or not eating bread. That’s true for some people, for sure. But I eat bread. \nYou asked me before, what is the unconscious? I think the unconscious is coming out right now between you and I. This idea that I’m the one that's generalizing is, I think, a defensive reaction to my talking about whiteness. You feel put on the spot and so I'm the one that's generalizing. \nSo you don’t think that you are generalizing? \nThis idea that I’m the one generalizing is actually defensive. Do I really believe on some level that every single white person is racist? No. Clearly. I have one percent left of that friend group. [In the lecture, Dr. Khilanani explains she has cut most of her white friends out of her life.] So no, I don’t. At the same time, I'm saying how it functions psychologically when someone says “You can’t say that,” and “Not all of us,” what you’re saying subconsciously is “I’m the exception to what you just said and you made me feel like I'm a racist and I don't experience myself that way. I do not want to experience myself as a racist and I'm going to turn the tables on you and say you're the racist because you're generalizing and that’s what a racist does.\"\nLet's talk about your practice. You've mentioned that you treat a lot of white people and you treat “whiteness.” What is the distinction between the two? \nI wouldn’t say there is a distinction. For example, for white women, I do help a lot with passive-aggressiveness — not being able to use their voice, say things, feeling like there will be a negative consequence. White people have an intense level of guilt. I have never seen a level of guilt that I see among white people. I mean, white people don't eat bread. Think about that. There have been wars all over the world over grains and bread and only here, white people are depriving themselves. Think about that shit. Everyone has this gluten allergy and you're like, what the fuck is a gluten allergy? That's a psychosomatic symptom. If you actually talk to a GI doctor, they're going to say, “Well, there’s Celiac and there's everything else” with a wink, and you know what the “everything else” is. It’s all the guilty gluten people. \nSure. There are lots of white people who don't eat bread, although I am not one of them. I exclusively eat bread, and I’m also skeptical of some claims of gluten intolerance but my assumption has always been that they’re just buying into pseudoscientific B.S. and following health trends. You think it’s white guilt? \nOn an emotional level, absolutely. Like, if I raise an eyebrow at a white person around bread, the first response is like, “It’s real.” What does that mean? They mean it’s not psychological.\nRight. It’s a medical issue, not a mental one. \nI don’t deny that people may get symptoms, but how is it that all these people suddenly now, after all the violence has occurred, are not eating bread. It’s like the weirdest fucking thing. \nBut what does bread have to do with violence? What’s the connection there? \nI think the bread is about guilt and needing to keep them in a state of deprivation and stay guilty. \nDo you think white people should feel guilty? \nNo, I think guilt is the most useless emotion on the planet. What function does it serve? It's not helpful. \nLet's talk about your talk, “The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind.” How did you get invited to do Grand Rounds at Yale in the first place? \nI was invited to do it. A big part of my practice is also doing consultations for marginalized people and how they've been harmed in treatments, usually psychiatric or psychological treatments.\nOk so the talk was in April, and it was public? \nYes. \nSo walk me through what happened. You get invited, you give them the title of the talk, and then what?\nNothing. There was not a response for a long period of time. I was kind of surprised because usually people want to know a lot of details. And then I think, and I’m not sure about this, maybe they only put the announcement out the day before. \nSo not a lot of notice.  \nI’m not sure. This is what I think because I only got the concerns as relayed to me from the dean right before. I didn’t hear any concerns prior to that. \nLet me pull up the email you forwarded me from the dean real quick. The message is from someone in the department to the dean and it says: “Good morning, I was surprised to see the announcement for tomorrow’s grand rounds. I imagine replacing the words ‘white mind’ with ‘Asian mind’ or ‘gay mind’ as we work towards equity and inclusion and unity. I wonder what impact this presentation will have.” Let's just address that. “Imagine replacing the words ‘white mind’ with ‘Asian mind’ or ‘gay mind’ as we work towards equity and inclusion and unity.” What’s your response to this? Does this person have a point? \nI think part of the anxiety is my using the word “white” and them having to reflect on that. And there was the use of the word “equity.” When I’m breaking this down psychologically, what they’re saying on some level is like, “We need things to be the same. If you can say ‘white,’ we can say ‘Asian.’” Psychologically, they’re actually making a false equivalence. What they’re doing psychologically is obliterating the difference between white and Asian, and if you obliterate the difference there’s no fucking problem here so shut up, you're the real racist. That’s how it functions psychologically. \nLet’s go through a bit of your talk here. You write: “This is the cost of talking to white people at all. The cost of your own life, as they suck you dry. There are no good apples out there. White people make my blood boil. Around five years ago, I took some actions. I systematically white-ghosted most of my white friends. And got rid of the couple white BIPOCs that snuck in my crew too. I  stopped watching the news. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. I have less than one percent left.  It was also a public service. I had fantasies of unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way, burying their body, and wiping my bloody hands as I walked away relatively guiltless with a bounce in my step. Like I did the world a fucking favor.” I can imagine that for some people the response to hearing a respected professional like yourself say that white people suck you dry and there are no good apples is going to be shame.\nI think what a lot of people felt wasn’t shame but horror that I was in touch with aggressive feelings. \nSure. That makes sense. Do you find that this sort of rhetoric is effective or do people reject what you're saying because it is violent? \nBefore I gave the talk, I said, I want you to observe your thoughts and feelings as I talk. I said, there's a difference between a thought, a fantasy, and an action. Now, my reflection on my own rage was actually that I was feeling impotent. So that's where I was going with that. And kind of normalizing feelings of hatred. This is stuff that exists and I need to dive deep within myself to reflect on how it is that I got here. So there is a reality here, like did I actually cut white people out of my life? Absolutely.\nWhen you were going through this process of cutting white people out of your life, what specifically would lead you to that decision? \nHaving the same conversations with people on repeat. People getting defensive, needing to argue, being unable to take in what I’m saying. An ability to say they’re not racist. And on repeat. I think my favorite responses were, “Well, you’re really sensitive. You’re over-reacting.” Focusing on my feelings. White women will often tell me that I’m really edgy and I’m like, “That’s so interesting that you're focused on my edginess. Have you reflected on why they might be?” But they can’t go there. \nThis reminds me a bit of Robin D’Angelo's writings, where she talks about how often in her trainings, the response from white women in particular is being defensive and shutting down. She calls this “white fragility,” but I'm curious about the effect. Do you find this is effective? \nIt depends on who my audience is. Do I think that that is effective for someone who is not in a place where they think there’s a problem with them? No, I don’t. Do I think it's effective for people who are a little bit scared but also kind of curious? Yeah, I do. I know my audience and what my own limits are. I’m for the people who want to walk into the other room and see how we view you. That’s who my audience is. In a private practice setting, no, I don’t do that and that’s because it's a fucking asshole thing to do. I need to be where they are at. When I’m speaking publicly, I need to invite someone into my room. This is how I talk with other people of color, this is how I talk with my black friends, this is how I talk with my Asian friends. This is how we talk about you. When I have patients, it's the other way around. I need to be humble and be where they're at. I need to sit with them and understand what they are going through. I feel like I've deepened a lot of my empathy for how much white people suffer from my white patients. \nLet’s go through some other sections of the talk. \nDid you have any reaction to it?\nI found parts of it difficult to hear, for sure. I also found it refreshingly honest. There was one part that I really liked. You say: “White people love talking about race right now. You cannot get them to shut the fuck up. It makes them feel good. And, they also imagine it makes us feel good to see their true enlightenment. Talking  about racism is a form of self-congratulatory masturbation. White people exchange pleasantries,  without really addressing racism. It serves no purpose in connecting other than to jerk themselves off.” \nI’m surrounded by people who do that, especially on social media. I find it very performative and it seems disingenuous. It also just seemed to appear overnight after the death of George Floyd. It's like every one I know decided to be an anti-racist the next day. They might not have known what that meant but they bought “White Fragility” and Ibram Kendi and maybe read them or maybe just posted photos of them on social media. It felt very performative and self-congratulatory and trendy to me. But I am curious about what you see is the solution here, because you say that white people love talking about race but in another part, you say that talking with white people about race is a “waste of our breath.” You say, “We are asking a demented, violent predator who thinks they are a saint or a superhero, to accept responsibility. They have five holes in their brain. It’s not going to happen. It’s like banging your head against a brick wall. Not a good idea.” But you do talk to white people about race. You were doing it at Yale. Walk me through that. \nI’m saying that talking about race right now like white people are doing, like occupying that much space for something they’ve never actually gone through but see themselves as self-appointed experts as, it serves a defensive function to not feel a negative feeling because if you're teaching about it and you're able to give and help, you don’t actually have to do the thing that is harder, which is feel negative feelings. So when I was saying that talking to white people is useless, I'm not actually really saying it's useless because if I really thought it was useless I wouldn't devote time to doing this. I'm talking about an experience that I have, that people of color have, of futility when coming up against a psychological defense. So it’s an experience of futility.\nSo do you think white people who talk about racism all the time, and I think we could probably picture the stereotype of how that might be, do you think that they're easier to reach because at least they acknowledge the existence of racism? \nNo, I think they’re harder to reach. Their defenses are up, right? You have to be very arrogant to imagine that you're suddenly a teacher of something you're never gone through. That is an incredible level of arrogance. Your psychological defenses are high, they’re intact, they’re rigid. So that is actually harder. People are feeling very upset right now that what they thought they were going to have — a job, a position — is suddenly now being threatened by people of color. Now actually talking about that and saying that out loud is healthier because they can say it. They're like. “I’m mad. I thought that I should be able to get this thing and now I feel like it's been taken away from me.” That’s a lot of people’s experience right now. Suddenly they feel like what should be rightfully theirs has been taken away. But actually what's happening is that the playing field is being leveled and they have to go through a loss as they lose their unearned advantage. That’s hard. But if someone doesn't have access to that feeling and can't get mad or feel pissed off because they don't think that exists, that’s harder. That's going to be harder for them emotionally. They’ll be like, “It’s fine, I’m fine.” How could you be fine? Your entire world operated one way and suddenly what you thought was certain and what you thought was going to be yours, you are no longer sure is going to be coming your way. That's scary. \nWhen you talk about it like that it does seem like you think that white people are going to have to give something up for equity. Do you think that's true and if so what is that thing that white people are going to have to give up? \nIt’s not a thing. It’s a way of being. It's a level of certainty and control that just kind of came for them before. \nAre you talking about jobs or money or . . . ?\nYeah, a lot of things. But I also think there's a loss they have to go through that is psychological, too, and this might be the harder thing. If you know one way of existing and that's been your way of existing and suddenly that feels like it’s changing on you, that’s terrifying. \nA lot of people say that the election of Donald Trump was a reaction to this, but then Donld Trump had a higher share of black and Latino votes in 2020. How do you explain something like that? \nIt’s internalized whiteness. After a period of time, you're going to start internalizing these things because you're attacked. \nYou say in your talk, “I got rid of the couple white BIPOCs that snuck in my crew too.” What is a white BIPOC?\nIt's someone who has internalized a lot of these thoughts. It's the same thing.\nThe way that you talk about whiteness, it’s almost like it’s a state of being. Is that correct?\nI would say it’s a state of mind that affects how you think consciously and how you think unconsciously. \nAre all white people afflicted by whiteness?\nIt’s impossible to not be. You would have to do an incredible level of work to not be. \nIt sounded like your talk was very well received by the audience. But what happened afterwards?\nThere were a lot of delays before Yale posted it. They said they were going to put out the talk the following Monday and that they had received a ton of requests for this talk so they wanted to get it up quickly. And then it didn’t happen. People started emailing them requesting the talk and they got very different responses. First they were saying that there were some technical difficulties and then they told another person that this was a chronic issue and that there are many other talks that need to be released and they need to go in order. That was brand new. Like, if you’ve been working on this for six weeks, why not say that before? “It’s white amnesia, I just suddenly remembered that we are having this IT difficulty. Whoops!” Then I begin to hear from different people that there is this stuff going on at Yale about the talk, that there’s pressure building, that a lot of the people wanted to know what was going on, so people started to complain internally and demand that the video be put up. Then they released it internally only. Of course they didn’t call me during any of this. \nWhen we were corresponding via email you said people were afraid. What are they afraid of?\nI guess it would be retaliation. It's sort of like that question you asked me about racism when I was in residency, and it's like this stuff happens to me every minute of every day. They get very angry if you start to stick up for yourself. It really elicits a lot of rage and a lot of retaliation. \nAnd this was people trying to get access to the video, they were afraid to ask for it?\nI think people were afraid to put their names on things, that kinda thing. \nIt’s interesting that you say that because I’ve been interviewing clinicians for this series who are opposed to social justice ideology in medicine and who see the need for progress but who don't like what’s going on. And nobody will put their name on anything. A lot of people talk about how cancel culture is stifling discourse and people are afraid of consequences, so it’s interesting to me that we’re talking about two different groups of people and these people who aren’t woke are afraid and you’re saying that the people who are woke are afraid, too. What does that tell you about the moment that we’re living in right now?\nThat everyone is scared to change, I think. People of color are scared of retaliation and consequences for speaking and owning their own thoughts. It’s a responsibility issue, too. If you are opposed to social justice, why wouldn’t you say that? \nBecause they’re afraid. They all say the same thing, they think they’ll be penalized if it's known that they oppose antiracism. They’re afraid of retaliation. \nThey’re afraid of retaliation or afraid of being judged?\nProbably both. There have been examples of people who’ve lost their jobs. You see people fired for a bad tweet or lost their attending privileges because of a tweet. \nEveryone is terrified and it might be different what that terror is, but for the people who are opposed to it, I wonder if they’re doing any work with their thoughts and feelings or their own, what their fears and anxieties are.\n\n\nIf you appreciate the work we’re doing, please support us by subscribing:\nSubscribe now","enclosure":{"url":"https://api.substack.com/feed/podcast/37183799.mp3","length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg"},"dc:creator":"Katie Herzog","content":"Listen now (51 min) | A psychiatrist lecturing at Yale's Child Study Center spoke about 'unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way.'","contentSnippet":"Listen now (51 min) | A psychiatrist lecturing at Yale's Child Study Center spoke about 'unloading a revolver into the head of any white person that got in my way.'","guid":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/the-psychopathic-problem-of-the-white","isoDate":"2021-06-04T15:05:33.000Z","itunes":{}},{"creator":"Katie Herzog","title":"What Happens When Doctors Can't Tell the Truth?","link":"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/what-happens-when-doctors-cant-speak","pubDate":"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:12:50 GMT","content:encoded":"<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-969-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41df6686-5cf4-4fea-862d-f72206316641_3000x1996.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41df6686-5cf4-4fea-862d-f72206316641_3000x1996.jpeg\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/41df6686-5cf4-4fea-862d-f72206316641_3000x1996.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2880437,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.5521978021978%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.5521978021978%, 969px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 969px;\n          }\n        </style></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Several hundred health-care workers protest against police brutality on June 5, 2020, in St Louis.

They vary in ethnicity, age and sexual orientation. Some work for the best hospitals in the U.S. or teach at top medical schools. Others are dedicated to serving the most vulnerable populations in their communities.&nbsp;</p><p>The meetings are largely a support group. The members share their concerns about what&#8217;s going on in their hospitals and universities, and strategize about what to do. What is happening, they say, is the rapid spread of a deeply illiberal ideology in the country&#8217;s most important medical institutions.&nbsp;</p><p>This dogma goes by many imperfect names &#8212; wokeness, social justice, critical race theory, anti-racism &#8212; but whatever it&#8217;s called, the doctors say this ideology is stifling critical thinking and dissent in the name of progress. They say that it&#8217;s turning students against their teachers and patients and racializing even the smallest interpersonal interactions. Most concerning, they insist that it is threatening the foundations of patient care, of research, and of medicine itself.</p><p>These aren&#8217;t secret bigots who long for the &#8220;good old days&#8221; that were bad for so many. They are largely politically progressive, and they are the first to say that there are inequities in medicine that must be addressed. Sometimes it&#8217;s overt racism from colleagues or patients, but more often the problem is deeper, baked into the very systems clinicians use to determine treatment.</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a calculator that people have used for decades that predicts the likelihood of having a successful vaginal delivery after you've had a cesarean,&#8221; one obstetrician in the Northeast told me. &#8220;You put in the age of the person, how much they weigh, and their race. And if they&#8217;re black, it calculates that they are less likely to have successful vaginal delivery. That means clinicians are more likely to counsel black patients to get c-sections, a surgery they might not actually need.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>There&#8217;s no biological reason for race to be a factor here, which is why the <a href=\"https://mfmunetwork.bsc.gwu.edu/web/mfmunetwork/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-calculator\">calculator</a> just changed this year. But this is an example of how system-wide bias can harm black mothers, who are two to three times more likely to die in childbirth than white women even when you control for factors like income and education, which often make racial disparities disappear.</p><p>But while this obstetrician and others see the problems endemic in their field, they&#8217;re also alarmed by the dogma currently spreading throughout medical schools and hospitals.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#8217;ve heard from doctors who&#8217;ve been reported to their departments for criticizing residents for being late. (It was seen by their trainees as an act of racism.) I&#8217;ve heard from doctors who&#8217;ve stopped giving trainees honest feedback for fear of retaliation. I&#8217;ve spoken to those who have seen clinicians and residents refuse to treat patients based on their race or their perceived conservative politics. </p><p>Some of these doctors say that there is a &#8220;purge&#8221; underway in the world of American medicine: question the current orthodoxy and you will be pushed out.&nbsp;They are so worried about the dangers of speaking out about their concerns that they will not let me identify them except by the region of the country where they work.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;People are afraid to speak honestly,&#8221; said a doctor who immigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet Union. &#8220;It&#8217;s like back to the USSR, where you could only speak to the ones you trust.&#8221; If the authorities found out, you could lose your job, your status, you could go to jail or worse. The fear here is not dissimilar.&nbsp;</p><p>When doctors do speak out, shared another, &#8220;the reaction is savage. And you better be tenured and you better have very thick skin.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re afraid of what's happening to other people happening to us,&#8221; a doctor on the West Coast told me. &#8220;We are seeing people being fired. We are seeing people's reputations being sullied. There are members of our group who say, &#8216;I will be asked to leave a board. I will endanger the work of the nonprofit that I lead if this comes out.&#8217; People are at risk of being totally marginalized and having to leave their institutions.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>While the hyper focus on identity is seen by many proponents of social justice ideology as a necessary corrective to America&#8217;s past sins, some people working in medicine are deeply concerned by what &#8220;justice&#8221; and &#8220;equity&#8221; actually look like in practice. </p><p>&#8220;The intellectual foundation for this movement is the Marxist view of the world, but stripped of economics and replaced with race determinism,&#8221; one psychologist explained. &#8220;Because you have a huge group of people, mostly people of color, who have been underserved, it was inevitable that this model was going to be applied to the world of medicine. And it has been.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&#8216;Whole Areas of Research Are Off-Limits&#8217;</strong></p><p>&#8220;Wokeness feels like an existential threat,&#8221; a doctor from the Northwest said. &#8220;In health care, innovation depends on open, objective inquiry into complex problems, but that&#8217;s now undermined by this simplistic and racialized worldview where racism is seen as the cause of all disparities, despite robust data showing it&#8217;s not that simple.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Whole research areas are off-limits,&#8221; he said, adding that some of what is being published in the nation&#8217;s top journals is &#8220;shoddy as hell.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Here, he was referring in part to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2020/08/12/1913405117.full.pdf\">study</a> published last year in the Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences. The study was covered all over the news, with headlines like &#8220;Black Newborns More Likely to Die When Looked After by White Doctors&#8221; (CNN), &#8220;The Lack of Black Doctors is Killing Black Babies&#8221; (Fortune), and &#8220;Black Babies More Likely to Survive when Cared for by Black Doctors&#8221; (The Guardian).</p><p>Despite these breathless headlines, the study was so <a href=\"https://medium.com/beingwell/can-white-doctors-treat-black-patients-61310d095a50\">methodologically flawed</a> that, according to several of the doctors I spoke with, it&#8217;s impossible to extrapolate any conclusions about how the race of the treating doctor impacts patient outcomes at all. And yet very few people were willing to publicly criticize it. As Vinay Prasad, a clinician and a professor at the University of California San Francisco, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VPrasadMDMPH/status/1296156538134913025?s=20\">put it</a> on Twitter: &#8220;I am aware of dozens of people who agree with my assessment of this paper and are scared to comment.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some of the most shoddy, methodologically flawed research we&#8217;ve ever seen published in these journals,&#8221; the doctor in the Zoom meeting said, &#8220;with sensational conclusions that seem totally unjustified from the results of the study.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating because we all know how hard it is to get good, sound research published,&#8221; he added. &#8220;So do those rules and quality standards no longer apply to this topic, or to these authors, or for a certain time period?&#8221;</p><p>At the same time that the bar appears to be lower for articles and studies that push an anti-racist agenda, the consequences for questioning or criticizing that agenda can be high.&nbsp;</p><p>Just ask Norman Wang. Last year, the University of Pittsburgh cardiologist was demoted by his department after he published a <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.120.015959\">paper</a> in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) analyzing and criticizing diversity initiatives in cardiology. Looking at 50 years of data, Wang argued that affirmative action and other diversity initiatives have failed to both meaningfully increase the percentage of black and Hispanic clinicians in his field or to improve patient outcomes. Rather than admitting, hiring and promoting clinicians based on their race, he argued for race-neutral policies in medicine.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Long-term academic solutions and excellence should not be sacrificed for short-term demographic optics,&#8221; Wang wrote. &#8220;Ultimately, all who aspire to a profession in medicine and cardiology must be assessed as individuals on the basis of their personal merits, not their racial and ethnic identities.&#8221;</p><p>At first, there was little response. But four months after it was published, screenshots of the paper began circulating on Twitter and others in the field began accusing Wang of racism. Sharonne Hayes, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SharonneHayes/status/1290047712239419393\">implored </a>colleagues to &#8220;rise up.&#8221; &#8220;The fact that this is published in &#8216;our&#8217; journal should both enrage &amp; activate all of us,&#8221; she wrote, adding the hashtag #RetractRacists.</p><p>Soon after, Barry London, the editor in chief of JAHA, issued an <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014592\">apology</a> and the journal retracted the work over Wang&#8217;s objection. London cited no specific errors in Wang&#8217;s paper in his statement, just that publishing it was antithetical to his and the journal&#8217;s values. Retraction, in a case like this, is exceedingly rare: When papers are retracted, it&#8217;s generally because of the data or the study has been discredited. A search of the journal&#8217;s website and the <a href=\"http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1#?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3d1%26jou%3dJournal%2bof%2bthe%2bAmerican%2bHeart%2bAssociation\">Retraction Database</a> found records of just two retractions in JAHA: Wang&#8217;s paper and a 2019 paper that erroneously linked heart attacks to vaping.</p><p>After the outcry, the American Heart Association (AHA), which publishes the journal, issued a <a href=\"https://newsroom.heart.org/news/wang-paper-is-wrong-diversity-equity-and-inclusiveness-in-medicine-and-cardiology-are-important-and-necessary\">statement</a> denouncing Wang&#8217;s paper and promising an investigation. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/American_Heart/status/1290494789297664003?s=20\">tweet</a>, the organization said it &#8220;does NOT represent AHA values. JAHA is editorially independent but that&#8217;s no excuse. We&#8217;ll investigate. We&#8217;ll do better. We&#8217;re invested in helping to build a diverse health care and research community.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>As the criticism mounted, Wang was removed from his position as the director of a fellowship program in clinical cardiac electrophysiology at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and was prohibited from making any contact with students. His boss <a href=\"https://www.cir-usa.org/cases/norman-wang-v-university-of-pittsburgh-et-al/\">reportedly</a> told him that his classroom was &#8220;inherently unsafe&#8221; due to the views he expressed.</p><p>Wang is now <a href=\"https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/lawsuit-filed-against\">suing</a> both the AHA and the University of Pittsburgh for defamation and violating his First Amendment rights. To the doctors on the Zoom call, his case was a stark warning of what can happen when one questions policies like affirmative action, which, according to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/25/most-americans-say-colleges-should-not-consider-race-or-ethnicity-in-admissions/\">recent polling</a>, is opposed by nearly two-thirds of Americans, including majorities of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m into efforts to make medicine more diverse,&#8221; a doctor from the Zoom group said. &#8220;But what&#8217;s gone off the rails here is that there is an intolerance of people that have another point of view. And that's going to hurt us all.&#8221;</p><p>JAHA isn&#8217;t the only journal issuing apologies. In February, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/health/jama-bauchner-race-medicine.html\">released a podcast</a> hosted by surgeon and then-deputy journal editor Edward Livingston, who questioned the value of the hyper focus on race in medicine as well as the idea that medicine is systemically racist.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Personally, I think taking racism out of the conversation will help,&#8221; Livingston said at one point. &#8220;Many of us are offended by the concept that we are racist.&#8221;</p><p>It&#8217;s possible Livingston&#8217;s comments would have gone unnoticed but JAMA promoted the podcast on Twitter with the tone-deaf text: &#8220;No physician is racist, so how can there be structural racism in health care?&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Even more than in the case of Norman Wang, this tweet, and the podcast it promoted, led to a massive uproar. A number of researchers vowed to boycott the journal, and a petition condemning JAMA has received over 9,000 signatures. In response to the backlash, JAMA quickly deleted the episode, promised to investigate, and asked Livingston to resign from his job. He did.</p><p>If you try to access the podcast today, you find an apology in its place from JAMA editor-in-chief Howard Bauchner, who called Livingston&#8217;s statements, &#8220;inaccurate, offensive, hurtful and inconsistent with the standards of JAMA.&#8221; Bauchner was also suspended by JAMA pending an independent investigation. This Tuesday, JAMA announced that Bauchner <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/health/jama-bauchner-racism.html\">officially stepped down</a>. In a statement, he said he is &#8220;profoundly disappointed in myself for the lapses that led to the publishing of the tweet and podcast. Although I did not write or even see the tweet, or create the podcast, as editor in chief, I am ultimately responsible for them.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after this announcement, the <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/health/jama-racism-bauchner.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimesscience\">New York Times</a></em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/health/jama-racism-bauchner.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimesscience\"> reported</a> that &#8220;JAMA&#8217;s reckoning&#8221; led to a backlash from some JAMA members, who wrote in a letter to the organization that &#8220;there is a general feeling that the firing of the editors involved in the podcast was perhaps precipitous, possibly a blot on free speech and also possibly an example of reverse discrimination.&#8221; Bauchner&#8217;s last day at JAMA is June 30.</p><p><strong>Calling Out Patients</strong></p><p>What happened to Norman Wang, Edward Livingston, and Howard Bauchner contribute to what one clinician described as a &#8220;a chilly atmosphere.&#8221; That chill extends to teaching the next generation of doctors.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Some attending physicians are hesitant to provide constructive criticism to trainees over fears of being perceived as racist,&#8221; a doctor in the Northeast said. &#8220;You ask yourself, &#8216;Is this worth bringing up?&#8217; You second guess yourself.&#8221;</p><p>The doctor said this ideology has impacted how some trainees and physicians respond when they encounter bias from patients, which is hardly uncommon for people working in health care. Female doctors are mistaken for nurses. Black doctors are mistaken for aides. Patients refuse care from doctors who aren&#8217;t white.&nbsp;</p><p>A Jewish doctor in the Northeast told me about encountering antisemitism at work.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;Years ago, I had a guy slowly roll up his sleeve and put his arm down on the table in front of me and he had a big swastika tattoo. And he says my name and repeats it slowly three times. Clearly he is saying he knows I&#8217;m Jewish. And I looked at his arm and said, &#8216;Does it hurt to get a tattoo? I never learned much about that.&#8217; He actually chuckled.&#8221;</p><p>The doctor kept seeing the patient, who gradually stopped doing drugs, got a job, and pieced his life together. &#8220;Twelve years later,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was leaving that program and on our last visit, he had a terrible rash on his arm. I said we had to treat that rash, and this big, tough guy started crying. He said, &#8216;I knew I was going to see you. I was trying to rub it off.&#8217; How about that? People are changeable, but it takes time and it can&#8217;t be done by scolding.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>This was what he was taught in his training years ago: You meet patients where they are, help them as much as you can, and hope they are better off for the encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>That philosophy, however, is changing. Increasingly, the doctors told me, this next generation of trainees seem to believe it&#8217;s also their duty to confront patients about their own prejudice &#8212; whether they&#8217;re open to it or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year at Harvard Medical School, a seasoned psychiatrist interviewed an elderly white patient about his battle with substance abuse on Zoom. The patient talked about shame. He felt so much guilt over his drinking and his past behavior, he said that the only person he could have ever confided in was an Eskimo in Alaska who didn&#8217;t speak English &#8212; and even then, he would have to slit his throat.</p><p>It was the sort of thing health-care workers occasionally hear. Historically, the guideline in a situation like that would be to ignore it: They were there to discuss addiction, not the patient&#8217;s insensitivity. But a Native American student named Victor Anthony Lopez-Carmen observing the session on Zoom was disturbed. He wrote about it later in <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/patient-racism-medical-school\">Teen Vogue</a>: &#8220;His words sparked an immediate, visceral reaction. I felt my blood pressure rise and anxiety overtake my mind and body. My next reaction was to look at how the rest of my classmates were responding. The blank, remote expression on some of their faces, and the silence that followed, remains burned into my psyche.&#8221;</p><p>When neither the psychiatrist nor any of his fellow students paused in the moment to educate the elderly man about his &#8220;violent and racist language,&#8221; as Lopez-Carmen described it, he complained. In response, the school organized a session for faculty and students on, Lopez-Carmen writes, &#8220;confronting anti-Indigenous racism in the field of medicine.&#8221;</p><p>Should clinicians police their patients&#8217; language to protect the feelings of their health-care providers? One doctor from the Zoom chat said, unequivocally, no.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;How would chastising, and possibly shaming, a patient &#8212; however expertly &#8212; affect their comfort in confiding sensitive information important to their care? Patients' life experiences, stories, attitudes, beliefs, whatever they may be, are data that help us take good care of them.&#8221;</p><p>As major medical institutions formalize their commitments to social justice ideology, the sentiment that medical professionals need to put aside their feelings in service of treating patients seems increasingly old-fashioned. Some institutions, including <a href=\"https://hms.harvard.edu/news/time-action\">Harvard Medical School</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/newsroom/apa-apology-for-its-support-of-structural-racism-in-psychiatry\">American Psychiatric Association</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.aappublications.org/news/2020/07/29/letter072920\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a>, and the American Medical Association (AMA), the largest association of physicians and medical students in the U.S., have released statements acknowledging their own history of racism, a trend one of the doctors described as &#8220;confessional.&#8221;</p><p>In an <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2021-05/ama-equity-strategic-plan.pdf\">83-page report </a>released in May, the AMA pledged address its &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; past, which includes horrific 19th-century practices like performing surgeries on enslaved people without anesthesia as well as the organization&#8217;s endorsement of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. But it&#8217;s not just ancient history the organization is concerned about: the report also mentions the JAMA podcast that cost Edward Livingston and Howard Bauchner their jobs, referring to the podcast as an &#8220;egregious, harmful error.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>The report recommendations rely heavily on diversity training, but as one of the doctors on the Zoom call said, &#8220;more diversity trainings are not going to change anything, but they are going to waste time we already don&#8217;t have to spare.&#8221;</p><p>There are, of course, an array of diversity trainings, including some that simply lay out anti-discrimination laws and others that require white people to confess their privilege. Trainings that may have seemed obviously racist just a few years ago &#8212; like separating employees into &#8220;affinity groups&#8221; or &#8220;caucuses&#8221; based on race &#8212; are now commonplace, including at <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/lockheed-martins-woke-industrial-complex\">large corporations</a>, <a href=\"https://barpodcast.fireside.fm/bonus2\">small non-profits</a>, and medical institutions. (My wife, a nurse in Seattle, recently joined the &#8220;white caucus&#8221; at her hospital, and noted that she felt very strange asking to join a whites-only group.)&nbsp;</p><p>The diversity industry is now worth <a href=\"https://time.com/5696943/diversity-business/\">billions of dollars</a>, but there have been surprisingly few evaluations of whether or not such trainings actually work. The research that has been done is not encouraging. One study found that these trainings can be <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/01/diversity-policies-dont-help-women-or-minorities-and-they-make-white-men-feel-threatened\">counterproductive</a>; another found that positive effects <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-29854-001\">don&#8217;t seem to last</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>What&#8217;s more, the doctors said, statements like the AMA&#8217;s seem destined to create backlash. &#8220;You have to wonder about the unintended consequences of these organizations falling over themselves to declare that they're structurally and systemically racist,&#8221; one of the doctors said. &#8220;Clearly, they think they&#8217;re going to get virtue-signaling points. But is it possible these claims are also playing into vaccine hesitancy among people of color? I mean, would you want to get vaccinated at an institution that&#8217;s enthusiastically broadcasting to the world, &#8216;We&#8217;re racist!&#8217; I wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p><strong>&#8216;I&#8217;m Not Going to Treat That White Guy&#8217;</strong></p><p>There&#8217;s clearly a generation gap between these doctors on Zoom, the youngest of whom has been practicing for at least 10 years, and doctors just beginning their career. The older clinicians are more likely to appear politically neutral, at least at work, while younger students and clinicians are more likely to prioritize activism. Those differences can be a major source of tension.&nbsp;</p><p>One prominent organization, White Coats for Black Lives, was formed by medical students in 2014 and now has at least 75 chapters all over the U.S. In addition to publishing a <a href=\"https://whitecoats4blacklives.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/RJRC-2019-Full-Report-Final-8.28.19.pdf\">Racial Justice Report Card</a> that grades medical schools, the group encourages medical students to make specific <a href=\"https://whitecoats4blacklives.org/2020/06/19/actions-speak-louder/\">demands</a> of their institutions, including that medical schools and hospitals end all relationships with local law enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked what severing ties with police would do in his urban emergency room, one ER doctor said it would be a &#8220;total disaster.&#8221; Police, he told me, are a vital part of emergency operations, from securing crime scenes so emergency responders can see victims to helping transport patients to keeping hospital staff and patients safe when private security is inadequate.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;I was in a situation once where an ambulance brought in a gunshot victim,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We brought the patient in, and about 15 minutes later, a group came looking for him. They came to finish him. They were going from room to room, looking for him, and when a couple of guys from hospital security tried to get them to leave, one shot a gun in the air. Luckily enough, we heard police sirens bringing someone else in, and when they heard the sirens, they ran. If not for the police, I don&#8217;t know what would have happened.&#8221;</p><p>As another example of the generation gap, an ER doctor on the West Coast said he sees providers, particularly younger ones, applying antiracist principles in choosing how they allocate their time and which patients they choose to work with.&nbsp; &#8220;I've heard examples of Covid-19 cases in the emergency department where providers go, &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to go treat that white guy, I'm going to treat the person of color instead because whatever happened to the white guy, he probably deserves it.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Some in medicine would like to see such race-conscious bias mandated on an institutional level, particularly in regards to Covid-19, which has killed black, Hispanic, and Native American people at three times the rate as whites. These discrepancies are likely due to an array of factors, including income, housing, work, language, pre-existing conditions, access to health care, and, yes, possibly some degree of racism.&nbsp;</p><p>But some politicians and public health officials decided the remedy was to distribute vaccines by race.</p><p>In April, Vermont&#8217;s Republican Governor Phill Scott announced that any resident over age 16 who identified as a black, indigenous, or a person of color would be eligible for the vaccine before white people, a decision that, according to some legal scholars, likely violated federal law. The CDC itself <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/12/18/vaccine-cdc-essential-workers-elderly-racial-covid-19/\">considered recommending that states prioritize essential workers</a> over the elderly despite the fact that the number one risk factor for dying from Covid is age. The idea had plenty of supporters. Harold Schmidt, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/05/health/covid-vaccine-first.html\">told</a> the New York Times, &#8220;Older populations are whiter. Society is structured in a way that enables them to live longer. Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit.&#8221;</p><p>Ultimately, the CDC did recommend prioritizing vaccines by age, but race-conscious policies go beyond Covid. In May, the <em><a href=\"https://bostonreview.net/science-nature-race/bram-wispelwey-michelle-morse-antiracist-agenda-medicine\">Boston Review</a></em> published an editorial by physicians Bram Wispelwey and Michelle Morse entitled &#8220;An Antiracist Agenda for Medicine.&#8221; In it, the doctors argue that in order to address discrepancies in health-care access and outcomes, hospitals should commit to &#8220;preferentially admitting patients historically denied access to certain forms of medical care.&#8221; That is, they should admit people to health services based on their skin color.&nbsp;</p><p>This idea is not coming from people with no power.</p><p>Michelle Morse is a physician at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital. She was <a href=\"https://freebeacon.com/policy/woke-medicine-comes-to-new-york-city/\">recently appointed</a> to be the first Chief Medical Officer of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. &#8220;Dr. Morse&#8217;s experience has combined the best of public health, social medicine, anti-racism education, and activism,&#8221; said Health Commissioner Dr. Dave A. Chokshi in a <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2021/health-department-appoints-first-chief-medical-officer.page\">press release</a>.&nbsp; &#8220;Health equity requires leaders who propel change and I am grateful that she has joined the Department to help us create a healthier, more equitable, city.&#8221;</p><p>In the same article in the <em>Boston Review</em>, Dr. Morse and her co-author write that because a <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/10/29/access-to-cardiac-units-may-explain-racial-gap-for-heart-failure-patients\">study</a> they conducted found that white heart failure patients are more likely to be referred to cardiology specialists than some minority groups, in their own practice they have developed &#8220;a preferential admission option for Black and Latinx heart failure patients to our specialty cardiology service.&#8221; So when these patients seek care, they are now far more likely to be referred to specialists and admitted to an inpatient service, regardless of whether that&#8217;s the most appropriate strategy for their condition, or their primary care providers&#8217; recommendations, or their own personal preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>What the authors don&#8217;t mention is that while their own study does show that white heart failure patients are more likely to be referred to specialists, this alone doesn&#8217;t demonstrate they&#8217;re more likely to have better outcomes: More whites in that very study died soon after discharge. This, according to one physician, is exactly what&#8217;s wrong with race-conscious policies.</p><p>&#8220;We have been working for almost a decade now to keep people from getting unnecessary care and unnecessary hospitalization because there are all these unintended consequences,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can get infected with an antibiotic-resistant bug; you can get the wrong medication; errors happen. We&#8217;re trying to keep people out of the hospital if they don't need to be there. So when you enact a policy like the one proposed by Michelle Morse, you&#8217;re just opening that person up to all these potentially negative consequences.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, in an effort to address racial disparities, it&#8217;s possible the very patients they are attempting to help will suffer more, not less.</p><p><strong>A Moral Panic</strong></p><p>The day I spoke to the doctors, I&#8217;d spent the morning caught in a labyrinth of hold calls, trying to find a new primary care doctor after my insurance had changed for the fourth time in five years. And I was one of the lucky ones: At least I have insurance, something nearly 30 million Americans in this country lack. Besides the problems with accessing health care at all, the doctors themselves told me the disparities in medicine aren&#8217;t imagined. Minority populations, especially poor ones, <em>do</em> have worse outcomes than whites in all sorts of metrics.&nbsp;</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got this opportunity right now to advance really important, progressive reforms,&#8221; one doctor said. &#8220;Every American understands that the system doesn&#8217;t work, that we need better public health, we need better primary care.&#8221; But this physician is concerned that &#8220;the people leading the woke effort have a deeply unsophisticated understanding of how change occurs in this country. It&#8217;s dangerous. I&#8217;m fearful there&#8217;s going to be a counter-reaction that's going to be huge and vicious and ugly.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><p>Others fear the same. Another doctor on the call, a psychologist, called the new orthodoxy a &#8220;moral panic&#8221; and &#8220;symbolic crusade,&#8221; like Prohibition, in which the outcome is less important than the sacredness of the movement.</p><p>&#8220;What happens with symbolic crusades is they overreach and you get a tremendous backlash,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;If hospitals actually adopt a policy of what can be construed as favoring black people in the ICU, can you imagine what conservative media would do with that? It would play into every fear that what this is really about is suppressing liberty, chilling free speech. I didn&#8217;t used to think those fears were legitimate. Now I do. I get it.&#8221;</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/what-happens-when-doctors-cant-speak?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;class&quot;:null}\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/what-happens-when-doctors-cant-speak?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share\"><span>Share</span></a></p>","content:encodedSnippet":"a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 66.5521978021978%;\n            padding-bottom: min(66.5521978021978%, 969px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-969-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 969px;\n          }\n        Several hundred health-care workers protest against police brutality on June 5, 2020, in St Louis. (Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images)\nI always thought that if you lived through a revolution it would be obvious to everyone. As it turns out, that’s not true. Revolutions can be bloodless, incremental and subtle. And they don’t require a strongman. They just require a sufficient number of well-positioned true believers and cowards, like those sitting in the C-suite of nearly every major institution in American life.\nThat’s one of the lessons I have learned over the past few years as the institutions that have upheld the liberal order — our publishing houses, our universities, our schools, our non-profits, our tech companies — have embraced a Manichean ideology that divides people by identity and punishes anyone that doesn’t adhere to every aspect of that orthodoxy. \nThis is wrong when it happens at a company Apple or Condé Nast. But there are sectors where the stakes of the ideological takeover are higher. Like K-12 education.\nReaders of this newsletter know that I’ve been particularly focused on it. In part, this is because the legacy press is ignoring or lying about the story. In part it’s because the stakes feel so high.\nBut if any area is more urgent, it is the world of medicine, where the ability to speak truthfully is quite literally a matter of life and death. Without being able to discuss reality and take intellectual risks, it’s impossible to get to the truth. No truth, no medical progress.\nFor several months, I have been talking to a group of doctors who are alarmed at what they are witnessing in some of the top medical schools and hospitals in the country. It was clear that this was a story that deserved to be told. And Katie Herzog was the perfect person to pursue it.\nKatie could have had a career as a stand-up, but for some reason she decided to become a journalist. And she is a fearless one. I first learned of her work when she was writing for The Stranger in Seattle, covering topics including detransition, the scandal at Evergreen State College, and the impact of what we now call cancel culture on some small businesses in the Pacific Northwest. She is now, along with Jesse Singal, the host of a podcast called Blocked and Reported. \nThis story is the first in a series.\nSubscribe now\n\n\n‘People Are Afraid to Speak Honestly’\nThey meet once a month on Zoom: a dozen doctors from around the country with distinguished careers in different specialities. They vary in ethnicity, age and sexual orientation. Some work for the best hospitals in the U.S. or teach at top medical schools. Others are dedicated to serving the most vulnerable populations in their communities. \nThe meetings are largely a support group. The members share their concerns about what’s going on in their hospitals and universities, and strategize about what to do. What is happening, they say, is the rapid spread of a deeply illiberal ideology in the country’s most important medical institutions. \nThis dogma goes by many imperfect names — wokeness, social justice, critical race theory, anti-racism — but whatever it’s called, the doctors say this ideology is stifling critical thinking and dissent in the name of progress. They say that it’s turning students against their teachers and patients and racializing even the smallest interpersonal interactions. Most concerning, they insist that it is threatening the foundations of patient care, of research, and of medicine itself.\nThese aren’t secret bigots who long for the “good old days” that were bad for so many. They are largely politically progressive, and they are the first to say that there are inequities in medicine that must be addressed. Sometimes it’s overt racism from colleagues or patients, but more often the problem is deeper, baked into the very systems clinicians use to determine treatment.\n“There’s a calculator that people have used for decades that predicts the likelihood of having a successful vaginal delivery after you've had a cesarean,” one obstetrician in the Northeast told me. “You put in the age of the person, how much they weigh, and their race. And if they’re black, it calculates that they are less likely to have successful vaginal delivery. That means clinicians are more likely to counsel black patients to get c-sections, a surgery they might not actually need.” \nThere’s no biological reason for race to be a factor here, which is why the calculator just changed this year. But this is an example of how system-wide bias can harm black mothers, who are two to three times more likely to die in childbirth than white women even when you control for factors like income and education, which often make racial disparities disappear.\nBut while this obstetrician and others see the problems endemic in their field, they’re also alarmed by the dogma currently spreading throughout medical schools and hospitals. \nI’ve heard from doctors who’ve been reported to their departments for criticizing residents for being late. (It was seen by their trainees as an act of racism.) I’ve heard from doctors who’ve stopped giving trainees honest feedback for fear of retaliation. I’ve spoken to those who have seen clinicians and residents refuse to treat patients based on their race or their perceived conservative politics. \nSome of these doctors say that there is a “purge” underway in the world of American medicine: question the current orthodoxy and you will be pushed out. They are so worried about the dangers of speaking out about their concerns that they will not let me identify them except by the region of the country where they work. \n“People are afraid to speak honestly,” said a doctor who immigrated to the U.S. from the Soviet Union. “It’s like back to the USSR, where you could only speak to the ones you trust.” If the authorities found out, you could lose your job, your status, you could go to jail or worse. The fear here is not dissimilar. \nWhen doctors do speak out, shared another, “the reaction is savage. And you better be tenured and you better have very thick skin.”\n“We’re afraid of what's happening to other people happening to us,” a doctor on the West Coast told me. “We are seeing people being fired. We are seeing people's reputations being sullied. There are members of our group who say, ‘I will be asked to leave a board. I will endanger the work of the nonprofit that I lead if this comes out.’ People are at risk of being totally marginalized and having to leave their institutions.” \nWhile the hyper focus on identity is seen by many proponents of social justice ideology as a necessary corrective to America’s past sins, some people working in medicine are deeply concerned by what “justice” and “equity” actually look like in practice. \n“The intellectual foundation for this movement is the Marxist view of the world, but stripped of economics and replaced with race determinism,” one psychologist explained. “Because you have a huge group of people, mostly people of color, who have been underserved, it was inevitable that this model was going to be applied to the world of medicine. And it has been.”  \n‘Whole Areas of Research Are Off-Limits’\n“Wokeness feels like an existential threat,” a doctor from the Northwest said. “In health care, innovation depends on open, objective inquiry into complex problems, but that’s now undermined by this simplistic and racialized worldview where racism is seen as the cause of all disparities, despite robust data showing it’s not that simple.”\n“Whole research areas are off-limits,” he said, adding that some of what is being published in the nation’s top journals is “shoddy as hell.” \nHere, he was referring in part to a study published last year in the Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences. The study was covered all over the news, with headlines like “Black Newborns More Likely to Die When Looked After by White Doctors” (CNN), “The Lack of Black Doctors is Killing Black Babies” (Fortune), and “Black Babies More Likely to Survive when Cared for by Black Doctors” (The Guardian).\nDespite these breathless headlines, the study was so methodologically flawed that, according to several of the doctors I spoke with, it’s impossible to extrapolate any conclusions about how the race of the treating doctor impacts patient outcomes at all. And yet very few people were willing to publicly criticize it. As Vinay Prasad, a clinician and a professor at the University of California San Francisco, put it on Twitter: “I am aware of dozens of people who agree with my assessment of this paper and are scared to comment.” \n“It’s some of the most shoddy, methodologically flawed research we’ve ever seen published in these journals,” the doctor in the Zoom meeting said, “with sensational conclusions that seem totally unjustified from the results of the study.”\n“It’s frustrating because we all know how hard it is to get good, sound research published,” he added. “So do those rules and quality standards no longer apply to this topic, or to these authors, or for a certain time period?”\nAt the same time that the bar appears to be lower for articles and studies that push an anti-racist agenda, the consequences for questioning or criticizing that agenda can be high. \nJust ask Norman Wang. Last year, the University of Pittsburgh cardiologist was demoted by his department after he published a paper in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) analyzing and criticizing diversity initiatives in cardiology. Looking at 50 years of data, Wang argued that affirmative action and other diversity initiatives have failed to both meaningfully increase the percentage of black and Hispanic clinicians in his field or to improve patient outcomes. Rather than admitting, hiring and promoting clinicians based on their race, he argued for race-neutral policies in medicine. \n“Long-term academic solutions and excellence should not be sacrificed for short-term demographic optics,” Wang wrote. “Ultimately, all who aspire to a profession in medicine and cardiology must be assessed as individuals on the basis of their personal merits, not their racial and ethnic identities.”\nAt first, there was little response. But four months after it was published, screenshots of the paper began circulating on Twitter and others in the field began accusing Wang of racism. Sharonne Hayes, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, implored colleagues to “rise up.” “The fact that this is published in ‘our’ journal should both enrage & activate all of us,” she wrote, adding the hashtag #RetractRacists.\nSoon after, Barry London, the editor in chief of JAHA, issued an apology and the journal retracted the work over Wang’s objection. London cited no specific errors in Wang’s paper in his statement, just that publishing it was antithetical to his and the journal’s values. Retraction, in a case like this, is exceedingly rare: When papers are retracted, it’s generally because of the data or the study has been discredited. A search of the journal’s website and the Retraction Database found records of just two retractions in JAHA: Wang’s paper and a 2019 paper that erroneously linked heart attacks to vaping.\nAfter the outcry, the American Heart Association (AHA), which publishes the journal, issued a statement denouncing Wang’s paper and promising an investigation. In a tweet, the organization said it “does NOT represent AHA values. JAHA is editorially independent but that’s no excuse. We’ll investigate. We’ll do better. We’re invested in helping to build a diverse health care and research community.” \nAs the criticism mounted, Wang was removed from his position as the director of a fellowship program in clinical cardiac electrophysiology at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and was prohibited from making any contact with students. His boss reportedly told him that his classroom was “inherently unsafe” due to the views he expressed.\nWang is now suing both the AHA and the University of Pittsburgh for defamation and violating his First Amendment rights. To the doctors on the Zoom call, his case was a stark warning of what can happen when one questions policies like affirmative action, which, according to recent polling, is opposed by nearly two-thirds of Americans, including majorities of blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. \n“I’m into efforts to make medicine more diverse,” a doctor from the Zoom group said. “But what’s gone off the rails here is that there is an intolerance of people that have another point of view. And that's going to hurt us all.”\nJAHA isn’t the only journal issuing apologies. In February, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) released a podcast hosted by surgeon and then-deputy journal editor Edward Livingston, who questioned the value of the hyper focus on race in medicine as well as the idea that medicine is systemically racist. \n“Personally, I think taking racism out of the conversation will help,” Livingston said at one point. “Many of us are offended by the concept that we are racist.”\nIt’s possible Livingston’s comments would have gone unnoticed but JAMA promoted the podcast on Twitter with the tone-deaf text: “No physician is racist, so how can there be structural racism in health care?” \nEven more than in the case of Norman Wang, this tweet, and the podcast it promoted, led to a massive uproar. A number of researchers vowed to boycott the journal, and a petition condemning JAMA has received over 9,000 signatures. In response to the backlash, JAMA quickly deleted the episode, promised to investigate, and asked Livingston to resign from his job. He did.\nIf you try to access the podcast today, you find an apology in its place from JAMA editor-in-chief Howard Bauchner, who called Livingston’s statements, “inaccurate, offensive, hurtful and inconsistent with the standards of JAMA.” Bauchner was also suspended by JAMA pending an independent investigation. This Tuesday, JAMA announced that Bauchner officially stepped down. In a statement, he said he is “profoundly disappointed in myself for the lapses that led to the publishing of the tweet and podcast. Although I did not write or even see the tweet, or create the podcast, as editor in chief, I am ultimately responsible for them.” \nShortly after this announcement, the New York Times reported that “JAMA’s reckoning” led to a backlash from some JAMA members, who wrote in a letter to the organization that “there is a general feeling that the firing of the editors involved in the podcast was perhaps precipitous, possibly a blot on free speech and also possibly an example of reverse discrimination.” Bauchner’s last day at JAMA is June 30.\nCalling Out Patients\nWhat happened to Norman Wang, Edward Livingston, and Howard Bauchner contribute to what one clinician described as a “a chilly atmosphere.” That chill extends to teaching the next generation of doctors. \n“Some attending physicians are hesitant to provide constructive criticism to trainees over fears of being perceived as racist,” a doctor in the Northeast said. “You ask yourself, ‘Is this worth bringing up?’ You second guess yourself.”\nThe doctor said this ideology has impacted how some trainees and physicians respond when they encounter bias from patients, which is hardly uncommon for people working in health care. Female doctors are mistaken for nurses. Black doctors are mistaken for aides. Patients refuse care from doctors who aren’t white. \nA Jewish doctor in the Northeast told me about encountering antisemitism at work. \n“Years ago, I had a guy slowly roll up his sleeve and put his arm down on the table in front of me and he had a big swastika tattoo. And he says my name and repeats it slowly three times. Clearly he is saying he knows I’m Jewish. And I looked at his arm and said, ‘Does it hurt to get a tattoo? I never learned much about that.’ He actually chuckled.”\nThe doctor kept seeing the patient, who gradually stopped doing drugs, got a job, and pieced his life together. “Twelve years later,” he said, “I was leaving that program and on our last visit, he had a terrible rash on his arm. I said we had to treat that rash, and this big, tough guy started crying. He said, ‘I knew I was going to see you. I was trying to rub it off.’ How about that? People are changeable, but it takes time and it can’t be done by scolding.” \nThis was what he was taught in his training years ago: You meet patients where they are, help them as much as you can, and hope they are better off for the encounter. \nThat philosophy, however, is changing. Increasingly, the doctors told me, this next generation of trainees seem to believe it’s also their duty to confront patients about their own prejudice — whether they’re open to it or not. \nLast year at Harvard Medical School, a seasoned psychiatrist interviewed an elderly white patient about his battle with substance abuse on Zoom. The patient talked about shame. He felt so much guilt over his drinking and his past behavior, he said that the only person he could have ever confided in was an Eskimo in Alaska who didn’t speak English — and even then, he would have to slit his throat.\nIt was the sort of thing health-care workers occasionally hear. Historically, the guideline in a situation like that would be to ignore it: They were there to discuss addiction, not the patient’s insensitivity. But a Native American student named Victor Anthony Lopez-Carmen observing the session on Zoom was disturbed. He wrote about it later in Teen Vogue: “His words sparked an immediate, visceral reaction. I felt my blood pressure rise and anxiety overtake my mind and body. My next reaction was to look at how the rest of my classmates were responding. The blank, remote expression on some of their faces, and the silence that followed, remains burned into my psyche.”\nWhen neither the psychiatrist nor any of his fellow students paused in the moment to educate the elderly man about his “violent and racist language,” as Lopez-Carmen described it, he complained. In response, the school organized a session for faculty and students on, Lopez-Carmen writes, “confronting anti-Indigenous racism in the field of medicine.”\nShould clinicians police their patients’ language to protect the feelings of their health-care providers? One doctor from the Zoom chat said, unequivocally, no. \n“How would chastising, and possibly shaming, a patient — however expertly — affect their comfort in confiding sensitive information important to their care? Patients' life experiences, stories, attitudes, beliefs, whatever they may be, are data that help us take good care of them.”\nAs major medical institutions formalize their commitments to social justice ideology, the sentiment that medical professionals need to put aside their feelings in service of treating patients seems increasingly old-fashioned. Some institutions, including Harvard Medical School, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Medical Association (AMA), the largest association of physicians and medical students in the U.S., have released statements acknowledging their own history of racism, a trend one of the doctors described as “confessional.”\nIn an 83-page report released in May, the AMA pledged address its “white supremacist” past, which includes horrific 19th-century practices like performing surgeries on enslaved people without anesthesia as well as the organization’s endorsement of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. But it’s not just ancient history the organization is concerned about: the report also mentions the JAMA podcast that cost Edward Livingston and Howard Bauchner their jobs, referring to the podcast as an “egregious, harmful error.” \nThe report recommendations rely heavily on diversity training, but as one of the doctors on the Zoom call said, “more diversity trainings are not going to change anything, but they are going to waste time we already don’t have to spare.”\nThere are, of course, an array of diversity trainings, including some that simply lay out anti-discrimination laws and others that require white people to confess their privilege. Trainings that may have seemed obviously racist just a few years ago — like separating employees into “affinity groups” or “caucuses” based on race — are now commonplace, including at large corporations, small non-profits, and medical institutions. (My wife, a nurse in Seattle, recently joined the “white caucus” at her hospital, and noted that she felt very strange asking to join a whites-only group.) \nThe diversity industry is now worth billions of dollars, but there have been surprisingly few evaluations of whether or not such trainings actually work. The research that has been done is not encouraging. One study found that these trainings can be counterproductive; another found that positive effects don’t seem to last. \nWhat’s more, the doctors said, statements like the AMA’s seem destined to create backlash. “You have to wonder about the unintended consequences of these organizations falling over themselves to declare that they're structurally and systemically racist,” one of the doctors said. “Clearly, they think they’re going to get virtue-signaling points. But is it possible these claims are also playing into vaccine hesitancy among people of color? I mean, would you want to get vaccinated at an institution that’s enthusiastically broadcasting to the world, ‘We’re racist!’ I wouldn’t.”\n‘I’m Not Going to Treat That White Guy’\nThere’s clearly a generation gap between these doctors on Zoom, the youngest of whom has been practicing for at least 10 years, and doctors just beginning their career. The older clinicians are more likely to appear politically neutral, at least at work, while younger students and clinicians are more likely to prioritize activism. Those differences can be a major source of tension. \nOne prominent organization, White Coats for Black Lives, was formed by medical students in 2014 and now has at least 75 chapters all over the U.S. In addition to publishing a Racial Justice Report Card that grades medical schools, the group encourages medical students to make specific demands of their institutions, including that medical schools and hospitals end all relationships with local law enforcement. \nWhen asked what severing ties with police would do in his urban emergency room, one ER doctor said it would be a “total disaster.” Police, he told me, are a vital part of emergency operations, from securing crime scenes so emergency responders can see victims to helping transport patients to keeping hospital staff and patients safe when private security is inadequate. \n“I was in a situation once where an ambulance brought in a gunshot victim,” he said. “We brought the patient in, and about 15 minutes later, a group came looking for him. They came to finish him. They were going from room to room, looking for him, and when a couple of guys from hospital security tried to get them to leave, one shot a gun in the air. Luckily enough, we heard police sirens bringing someone else in, and when they heard the sirens, they ran. If not for the police, I don’t know what would have happened.”\nAs another example of the generation gap, an ER doctor on the West Coast said he sees providers, particularly younger ones, applying antiracist principles in choosing how they allocate their time and which patients they choose to work with.  “I've heard examples of Covid-19 cases in the emergency department where providers go, ‘I’m not going to go treat that white guy, I'm going to treat the person of color instead because whatever happened to the white guy, he probably deserves it.’”\nSome in medicine would like to see such race-conscious bias mandated on an institutional level, particularly in regards to Covid-19, which has killed black, Hispanic, and Native American people at three times the rate as whites. These discrepancies are likely due to an array of factors, including income, housing, work, language, pre-existing conditions, access to health care, and, yes, possibly some degree of racism. \nBut some politicians and public health officials decided the remedy was to distribute vaccines by race.\nIn April, Vermont’s Republican Governor Phill Scott announced that any resident over age 16 who identified as a black, indigenous, or a person of color would be eligible for the vaccine before white people, a decision that, according to some legal scholars, likely violated federal law. The CDC itself considered recommending that states prioritize essential workers over the elderly despite the fact that the number one risk factor for dying from Covid is age. The idea had plenty of supporters. Harold Schmidt, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told the New York Times, “Older populations are whiter. Society is structured in a way that enables them to live longer. Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit.”\nUltimately, the CDC did recommend prioritizing vaccines by age, but race-conscious policies go beyond Covid. In May, the Boston Review published an editorial by physicians Bram Wispelwey and Michelle Morse entitled “An Antiracist Agenda for Medicine.” In it, the doctors argue that in order to address discrepancies in health-care access and outcomes, hospitals should commit to “preferentially admitting patients historically denied access to certain forms of medical care.” That is, they should admit people to health services based on their skin color. \nThis idea is not coming from people with no power.\nMichelle Morse is a physician at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She was recently appointed to be the first Chief Medical Officer of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. “Dr. Morse’s experience has combined the best of public health, social medicine, anti-racism education, and activism,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Dave A. Chokshi in a press release.  “Health equity requires leaders who propel change and I am grateful that she has joined the Department to help us create a healthier, more equitable, city.”\nIn the same article in the Boston Review, Dr. Morse and her co-author write that because a study they conducted found that white heart failure patients are more likely to be referred to cardiology specialists than some minority groups, in their own practice they have developed “a preferential admission option for Black and Latinx heart failure patients to our specialty cardiology service.” So when these patients seek care, they are now far more likely to be referred to specialists and admitted to an inpatient service, regardless of whether that’s the most appropriate strategy for their condition, or their primary care providers’ recommendations, or their own personal preferences. \nWhat the authors don’t mention is that while their own study does show that white heart failure patients are more likely to be referred to specialists, this alone doesn’t demonstrate they’re more likely to have better outcomes: More whites in that very study died soon after discharge. This, according to one physician, is exactly what’s wrong with race-conscious policies.\n“We have been working for almost a decade now to keep people from getting unnecessary care and unnecessary hospitalization because there are all these unintended consequences,” he said. “You can get infected with an antibiotic-resistant bug; you can get the wrong medication; errors happen. We’re trying to keep people out of the hospital if they don't need to be there. So when you enact a policy like the one proposed by Michelle Morse, you’re just opening that person up to all these potentially negative consequences.” \nIn other words, in an effort to address racial disparities, it’s possible the very patients they are attempting to help will suffer more, not less.\nA Moral Panic\nThe day I spoke to the doctors, I’d spent the morning caught in a labyrinth of hold calls, trying to find a new primary care doctor after my insurance had changed for the fourth time in five years. And I was one of the lucky ones: At least I have insurance, something nearly 30 million Americans in this country lack. Besides the problems with accessing health care at all, the doctors themselves told me the disparities in medicine aren’t imagined. Minority populations, especially poor ones, do have worse outcomes than whites in all sorts of metrics. \n“We’ve got this opportunity right now to advance really important, progressive reforms,” one doctor said. “Every American understands that the system doesn’t work, that we need better public health, we need better primary care.” But this physician is concerned that “the people leading the woke effort have a deeply unsophisticated understanding of how change occurs in this country. It’s dangerous. I’m fearful there’s going to be a counter-reaction that's going to be huge and vicious and ugly.” \nOthers fear the same. Another doctor on the call, a psychologist, called the new orthodoxy a “moral panic” and “symbolic crusade,” like Prohibition, in which the outcome is less important than the sacredness of the movement.\n“What happens with symbolic crusades is they overreach and you get a tremendous backlash,” he continued. “If hospitals actually adopt a policy of what can be construed as favoring black people in the ICU, can you imagine what conservative media would do with that? It would play into every fear that what this is really about is suppressing liberty, chilling free speech. I didn’t used to think those fears were legitimate. Now I do. I get it.”\nShare","enclosure":{"url":"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F41df6686-5cf4-4fea-862d-f72206316641_3000x1996.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Katie Herzog","content":"Whole areas of research are off-limits.
